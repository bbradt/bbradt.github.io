                        <p ">
Lo I the man, whose Muse whilome did maske,</br>
As time her taught in lowly Shepheards weeds,</br>
Am now enforst a far unfitter taske,</br>
For trumpets sterne to chaunge mine Oaten reeds,</br>
And sing of Knights and Ladies gentle deeds;</br>
Whose prayses having slept in silence long,</br>
Me, all too meane, the sacred Muse areeds</br>
To blazon broad emongst her learned throng:</br>
Fierce warres and faithful loves shall moralize my song.</br>
Helpe then, O holy Virgin chiefe of nine,</br>
Thy weaker Novice to performe thy will,</br>
Lay forth out of thine everlasting scryne</br>
The antique rolles, which there lye hidden still,</br>
Of Faerie knights and fairest Tanaquill,</br>
Whom that most noble Briton Prince so long</br>
Sought through the world, and suffered so much ill,</br>
That I must rue his undeserved wrong:</br>
O helpe thou my weake wit, and sharpen my dull tong.</br>
And thou most dreaded impe of highest Jove,</br>
Faire Venus sonne, that with thy cruell dart</br>
At that good knight so cunningly didst rove,</br>
That glorious fire it kindled in his hart,</br>
Lay now thy deadly Heben bow apart,</br>
And with thy mother milde come to mine ayde:</br>
Come both, and with you bring triumphant Mart,</br>
In loves and gentle jollities arrayd,</br>
After his murdrous spoiles and bloudy rage allayd.</br>
And with them eke, O Goddesse heavenly bright,</br>
Mirrour of grace and Majestie divine,</br>
Great Lady of the greatest Isle, whose light</br>
Like Phoebus lampe throughout the world doth shine,</br>
Shed thy faire beames into my feeble eyne,</br>
And raise my thoughts too humble and too vile,</br>
To thinke of that true glorious type of thine,</br>
The argument of mine afflicted stile:</br>
The which to heare, vouchsafe, O dearest dred a-while.</br>
</br>
i</br>
A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine,</br>
Y cladd in mightie armes and silver shielde,</br>
Wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remaine,</br>
The cruell markes of many a bloudy fielde;</br>
Yet armes till that time did he never wield:</br>
His angry steede did chide his foming bitt,</br>
As much disdayning to the curbe to yield:</br>
Full jolly knight he seemd, and faire did sitt,</br>
As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt.</br>
</br>
ii</br>
But on his brest a bloudie Crosse he bore,</br>
The deare remembrance of his dying Lord,</br>
For whose sweete sake that glorious badge he wore,</br>
And dead as living ever him ador'd:</br>
Upon his shield the like was also scor'd,</br>
For soveraine hope, which in his helpe he had:</br>
Right faithfull true he was in deede and word,</br>
But of his cheere did seeme too solemne sad;</br>
Yet nothing did he dread, but ever was ydrad.</br>
</br>
iii</br>
Upon a great adventure he was bond,</br>
That greatest Gloriana to him gave,</br>
That greatest Glorious Queene of Faerie lond,</br>
To winne him worship, and her grace to have,</br>
Which of all earthly things he most did crave;</br>
And ever as he rode, his hart did earne</br>
To prove his puissance in battell brave</br>
Upon his foe, and his new force to learne;</br>
Upon his foe, a Dragon horrible and stearne.</br>
</br>
iv</br>
A lovely Ladie rode him faire beside,</br>
Upon a lowly Asse more white then snow,</br>
Yet she much whiter, but the same did hide</br>
Under a vele, that wimpled was full low,</br>
And over all a blacke stole she did throw,</br>
As one that inly mournd: so was she sad,</br>
And heavie sat upon her palfrey slow;</br>
Seemed in heart some hidden care she had,</br>
And by her in a line a milke white lambe she lad.</br>
</br>
v</br>
So pure an innocent, as that same lambe,</br>
She was in life and every vertuous lore,</br>
And by descent from Royall lynage came</br>
Of ancient Kings and Queenes, that had of yore</br>
Their scepters stretcht from East to Westerne shore,</br>
And all the world in their subjection held;</br>
Till that infernall feend with foule uprore</br>
Forwasted all their land, and them expeld:</br>
Whom to avenge, she had this Knight from far compeld.</br>
</br>
vi</br>
Behind her farre away a Dwarfe did lag,</br>
That lasie seemd in being ever last,</br>
Or wearied with bearing of her bag</br>
Of needments at his backe. Thus as they past,</br>
The day with cloudes was suddeine overcast,</br>
And angry Jove an hideous storme of raine</br>
Did poure into his Lemans lap so fast,</br>
That every wight to shrowd it did constrain,</br>
And this faire couple eke to shroud themselves were fain.</br>
</br>
vii</br>
Enforst to seeke some covert nigh at hand,</br>
A shadie grove not far away they spide,</br>
That promist ayde the tempest to withstand:</br>
Whose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride,</br>
Did spred so broad, that heavens light did hide,</br>
Not perceable with power of any starre:</br>
And all within were pathes and alleies wide,</br>
With footing worne, and leading inward farre:</br>
Faire harbour that them seemes; so in they entred arre.</br>
</br>
viii</br>
And foorth they passe, with pleasure forward led,</br>
Joying to heare the birdes sweete harmony,</br>
Which therein shrouded from the tempest dred,</br>
Seemd in their song to scorne the cruell sky.</br>
Much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy,</br>
The sayling Pine, the Cedar proud and tall,</br>
The vine-prop Elme, the Poplar never dry,</br>
The builder Oake, sole king of forrests all,</br>
The Aspine good for staves, the Cypresse funerall.</br>
</br>
ix</br>
The Laurell, meed of mightie Conquerours</br>
And Poets sage, the Firre that weepeth still,</br>
The Willow worne of forlorne Paramours,</br>
The Eugh obedient to the benders will,</br>
The Birch for shaftes, the Sallow for the mill,</br>
The Mirrhe sweete bleeding in the bitter wound,</br>
The warlike Beech, the Ash for nothing ill,</br>
The fruitfull Olive, and the Platane round,</br>
The carver Holme, the Maple seeldom inward sound.</br>
</br>
x</br>
Led with delight, they thus beguile the way,</br>
Untill the blustring storme is overblowne;</br>
When weening to returne, whence they did stray,</br>
They cannot find that path, which first was showne,</br>
But wander too and fro in wayes unknowne,</br>
Furthest from end then, when they neerest weene,</br>
That makes them doubt, their wits be not their owne:</br>
So many pathes, so many turnings seene,</br>
That which of them to take, in diverse doubt they been.</br>
</br>
xi</br>
At last resolving forward still to fare,</br>
Till that some end they finde or in or out,</br>
That path they take, that beaten seemd most bare,</br>
And like to lead the labyrinth about;</br>
Which when by tract they hunted had throughout,</br>
At length it brought them to a hollow cave,</br>
Amid the thickest woods. The Champion stout</br>
Eftsoones dismounted from his courser brave,</br>
And to the Dwarfe a while his needlesse spere he gave.</br>
</br>
xii</br>
Be well aware, quoth then that Ladie milde,</br>
Least suddaine mischiefe ye too rash provoke:</br>
The danger hid, the place unknowne and wilde,</br>
Breeds dreadfull doubts: Oft fire is without smoke,</br>
And perill without show: therefore your stroke</br>
Sir knight with-hold, till further triall made.</br>
Ah Ladie (said he) shame were to revoke</br>
The forward footing for an hidden shade:</br>
Vertue gives her selfe light, through darkenesse for to wade.</br>
</br>
xiii</br>
Yea but (quoth she) the perill of this place</br>
I better wot then you, though now too late</br>
To wish you backe returne with foule disgrace,</br>
Yet wisedome warnes, whilest foot is in the gate,</br>
To stay the steppe, ere forced to retrate.</br>
This is the wandring wood, this Errours den,</br>
A monster vile, whom God and man does hate:</br>
Therefore I read beware. Fly fly (quoth then</br>
The fearefull Dwarfe:) this is no place for living men.</br>
</br>
xiv</br>
But full of fire and greedy hardiment,</br>
The youthfull knight could not for ought be staide,</br>
But forth unto the darksome hole he went,</br>
And looked in: his glistring armor made</br>
A litle glooming light, much like a shade,</br>
By which he saw the ugly monster plaine,</br>
Halfe like a serpent horribly displaide,</br>
But th'other halfe did womans shape retaine,</br>
Most lothsom, filthie, foule, and full of vile disdaine.</br>
</br>
xv</br>
And as she lay upon the durtie ground,</br>
Her huge long taile her den all overspred,</br>
Yet was in knots and many boughtes upwound,</br>
Pointed with mortall sting. Of her there bred</br>
A thousand yong ones, which she dayly fed,</br>
Sucking upon her poisonous dugs, eachone</br>
Of sundry shapes, yet all ill favored:</br>
Soone as that uncouth light upon them shone,</br>
Into her mouth they crept, and suddain all were gone.</br>
</br>
xvi</br>
Their dam upstart, out of her den effraide,</br>
And rushed forth, hurling her hideous taile</br>
About her cursed head, whose folds displaid</br>
Were stretcht now forth at length without entraile.</br>
She lookt about, and seeing one in mayle</br>
Armed to point, sought backe to turne againe;</br>
For light she hated as the deadly bale,</br>
Ay wont in desert darknesse to remaine,</br>
Where plaine none might her see, nor she see any plaine.</br>
</br>
xvii</br>
Which when the valiant Elfe perceiv'd, he lept</br>
As Lyon fierce upon the flying pray,</br>
And with his trenchand blade her boldly kept</br>
From turning backe, and forced her to stay:</br>
Therewith enrag'd she loudly gan to bray,</br>
And turning fierce, her speckled taile advaunst,</br>
Threatning her angry sting, him to dismay:</br>
Who nought aghast, his mightie hand enhaunst:</br>
The stroke down from her head unto her shoulder glaunst.</br>
</br>
xviii</br>
Much daunted with that dint, her sence was dazd,</br>
Yet kindling rage, her selfe she gathered round,</br>
And all attonce her beastly body raizd</br>
With doubled forces high above the ground:</br>
Tho wrapping up her wrethed sterne arownd,</br>
Lept fierce upon his shield, and her huge traine</br>
All suddenly about his body wound,</br>
That hand or foot to stirre he strove in vaine:</br>
God helpe the man so wrapt in Errours endlesse traine.</br>
</br>
xix</br>
His Lady sad to see his sore constraint,</br>
Cride out, Now now Sir knight, shew what ye bee,</br>
Add faith unto your force, and be not faint:</br>
Strangle her, else she sure will strangle thee.</br>
That when he heard, in great perplexitie,</br>
His gall did grate for griefe and high disdaine,</br>
And knitting all his force got one hand free,</br>
Wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine,</br>
That soone to loose her wicked bands did her constraine.</br>
</br>
xx</br>
Therewith she spewd out of her filthy maw</br>
A floud of poyson horrible and blacke,</br>
Full of great lumpes of flesh and gobbets raw,</br>
Which stunck so vildly, that it forst him slacke</br>
His grasping hold, and from her turne him backe:</br>
Her vomit full of bookes and papers was,</br>
With loathly frogs and toades, which eyes did lacke,</br>
And creeping sought way in the weedy gras:</br>
Her filthy parbreake all the place defiled has.</br>
</br>
xxi</br>
As when old father Nilus gins to swell</br>
With timely pride above the Aegyptian vale,</br>
His fattie waves do fertile slime outwell,</br>
And overflow each plaine and lowly dale:</br>
But when his later spring gins to avale,</br>
Huge heapes of mudd he leaves, wherein there breed</br>
Ten thousand kindes of creatures, partly male</br>
And partly female of his fruitfull seed;</br>
Such ugly monstrous shapes elsewhere may no man reed.</br>
</br>
xxii</br>
The same so sore annoyed has the knight,</br>
That welnigh choked with the deadly stinke,</br>
His forces faile, ne can no longer fight.</br>
Whose corage when the feend perceiv'd to shrinke,</br>
She poured forth out of her hellish sinke</br>
Her fruitfull cursed spawne of serpents small,</br>
Deformed monsters, fowle, and blacke as inke,</br>
Which swarming all about his legs did crall,</br>
And him encombred sore, but could not hurt at all.</br>
</br>
xxiii</br>
As gentle Shepheard in sweete even-tide,</br>
When ruddy Phoebus gins to welke in west,</br>
High on an hill, his flocke to vewen wide,</br>
Markes which do byte their hasty supper best;</br>
A cloud of combrous gnattes do him molest,</br>
All striving to infixe their feeble stings,</br>
That from their noyance he no where can rest,</br>
But with his clownish hands their tender wings</br>
He brusheth oft, and oft doth mar their murmurings.</br>
</br>
xxiv</br>
Thus ill bestedd, and fearefull more of shame,</br>
Then of the certaine perill he stood in,</br>
Halfe furious unto his foe he came,</br>
Resolv'd in minde all suddenly to win,</br>
Or soone to lose, before he once would lin;</br>
And strooke at her with more then manly force,</br>
That from her body full of filthie sin</br>
He raft her hatefull head without remorse;</br>
A streame of cole black bloud forth gushed from her corse.</br>
</br>
xxv</br>
Her scattred brood, soone as their Parent deare</br>
They saw so rudely falling to the ground,</br>
Groning full deadly, all with troublous feare,</br>
Gathred themselves about her body round,</br>
Weening their wonted entrance to have found</br>
At her wide mouth: but being there withstood</br>
They flocked all about her bleeding wound,</br>
And sucked up their dying mothers blood,</br>
Making her death their life, and eke her hurt their good.</br>
</br>
xxvi</br>
That detestable sight him much amazde,</br>
To see th'unkindly Impes of heaven accurst,</br>
Devoure their dam; on whom while so he gazd,</br>
Having all satisfide their bloudy thurst,</br>
Their bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse burst,</br>
And bowels gushing forth: well worthy end</br>
Of such as drunke her life, the which them nurst;</br>
Now needeth him no lenger labour spend,</br>
His foes have slaine themselves, with whom he should contend.</br>
</br>
xxvii</br>
His Ladie seeing all, that chaunst, from farre</br>
Approcht in hast to greet his victorie,</br>
And said, Faire knight, borne under happy starre,</br>
Who see your vanquisht foes before you lye:</br>
Well worthy be you of that Armorie,</br>
Wherein ye have great glory wonne this day,</br>
And proov'd your strength on a strong enimie,</br>
Your first adventure: many such I pray,</br>
And henceforth ever wish, that like succeed it may.</br>
</br>
xxviii</br>
Then mounted he upon his Steede againe,</br>
And with the Lady backward sought to wend;</br>
That path he kept, which beaten was most plame,</br>
Ne ever would to any by-way bend,</br>
But still did follow one unto the end,</br>
The which at last out of the wood them brought.</br>
So forward on his way (with God to frend)</br>
He passed forth, and new adventure sought;</br>
Long way he travelled, before he heard of ought.</br>
</br>
xxix</br>
At length they chaunst to meet upon the way</br>
An aged Sire, in long blacke weedes yclad,</br>
His feete all bare, his beard all hoarie gray,</br>
And by his belt his booke he hanging had;</br>
Sober he seemde, and very sagely sad,</br>
And to the ground his eyes were lowly bent,</br>
Simple in shew, and voyde of malice bad,</br>
And all the way he prayed, as he went,</br>
And often knockt his brest, as one that did repent.</br>
</br>
xxx</br>
He faire the knight saluted, louting low,</br>
Who faire him quited, as that courteous was:</br>
And after asked him, if he did know</br>
Of straunge adventures, which abroad did pas.</br>
Ah my deare Sonne (quoth he) how should, alas,</br>
Silly old man, that lives in hidden cell,</br>
Bidding his beades all day for his trespas,</br>
Tydings of warre and worldly trouble tell?</br>
With holy father sits not with such things to mell.</br>
</br>
xxxi</br>
But if of daunger which hereby doth dwell,</br>
And homebred evill ye desire to heare,</br>
Of a straunge man I can you tidings tell,</br>
That wasteth all this countrey farre and neare.</br>
Of such (said he) I chiefly do inquere,</br>
And shall you well reward to shew the place,</br>
In which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare:</br>
For to all knighthood it is foule disgrace,</br>
That such a cursed creature lives so long a space.</br>
</br>
xxxii</br>
Far hence (quoth he) in wastfull wildernesse</br>
His dwelling is, by which no living wight</br>
May ever passe, but thorough great distresse.</br>
Now (sayd the Lady) draweth toward night,</br>
And well I wote, that of your later fight</br>
Ye all forwearied be: for what so strong,</br>
But wanting rest will also want of might?</br>
The Sunne that measures heaven all day long,</br>
At night doth baite his steedes the Ocean waves emong.</br>
</br>
xxxiii</br>
Then with the Sunne take Sir, your timely rest,</br>
And with new day new worke at once begin:</br>
Untroubled night they say gives counsell best.</br>
Right well Sir knight ye have advised bin,</br>
(Quoth then that aged man;) the way to win</br>
Is wisely to advise: now day is spent;</br>
Therefore with me ye may take up your In</br>
For this same night. The knight was well content:</br>
So with that godly father to his home they went.</br>
</br>
xxxiv</br>
A little lowly Hermitage it was,</br>
Downe in a dale, hard by a forests side,</br>
Far from resort of people, that did pas</br>
In travell to and froe: a little wyde</br>
There was an holy Chappell edifyde,</br>
Wherein the Hermite dewly wont to say</br>
His holy things each morne and eventyde:</br>
Thereby a Christall streame did gently play,</br>
Which from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway.</br>
</br>
xxxv</br>
Arrived there, the little house they fill,</br>
Ne looke for entertainement, where none was:</br>
Rest is their feast, and all things at their will;</br>
The noblest mind the best contentment has.</br>
With faire discourse the evening so they pas:</br>
For that old man of pleasing wordes had store,</br>
And well could file his tongue as smooth as glas;</br>
He told of Saintes and Popes, and evermore</br>
He strowd an Ave-Mary after and before.</br>
</br>
xxxvi</br>
The drouping Night thus creepeth on them fast,</br>
And the sad humour loading their eye liddes,</br>
As messenger of Morpheus on them cast</br>
Sweet slombring deaw, the which to sleepe them biddes.</br>
Unto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes:</br>
Where when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes,</br>
He to his study goes, and there amiddes</br>
His Magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes,</br>
He seekes out mighty charmes, to trouble sleepy mindes.</br>
</br>
xxxvii</br>
Then choosing out few wordes most horrible,</br>
(Let none them read) thereof did verses frame,</br>
With which and other spelles like terrible,</br>
He bad awake blacke Plutoes griesly Dame,</br>
And cursed heaven, and spake reprochfull shame</br>
Of highest God, the Lord of life and light;</br>
A bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name</br>
Great Gorgon, Prince of darknesse and dead night,</br>
At which Cocytus quakes, and Styx is put to flight.</br>
</br>
xxxviii</br>
And forth he cald out of deepe darknesse dred</br>
Legions of Sprights, the which like little flyes</br>
Fluttring about his ever damned hed,</br>
A-waite whereto their service he applyes,</br>
To aide his friends, or fray his enimies:</br>
Of those he chose out two, the falsest twoo,</br>
And fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes;</br>
The one of them he gave a message too,</br>
The other by him selfe staide other worke to doo.</br>
</br>
xxxix</br>
He making speedy way through spersed ayre,</br>
And through the world of waters wide and peepe,</br>
To Morpheus house doth hastily repaire.</br>
Amid the bowels of the earth full steepe,</br>
And low, where dawning day doth never peepe,</br>
His dwelling is; there Tethys his wet bed</br>
Doth ever wash, and Cynthia still doth steepe</br>
In silver deaw his ever-drouping hed,</br>
Whiles sad Night over him her mantle black doth spred.</br>
</br>
xl</br>
Whose double gates he findeth locked fast,</br>
The one faire fram'd of burnisht Yvory,</br>
The other all with silver overcast;</br>
And wakefull dogges before them farre do lye</br>
Watching to banish Care their enimy,</br>
Who oft is wont to trouble gentle Sleepe.</br>
By them the Sprite doth passe in quietly,</br>
And unto Morpheus comes, whom drowned deepe</br>
In drowsie fit he findes: of nothing he takes keepe.</br>
</br>
xli</br>
And more, to lulle him in his slumber soft,</br>
A trickling streame from high rocke tumbling downe</br>
And ever-drizling raine upon the loft,</br>
Mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne</br>
Of swarming Bees, did cast him in a swowne:</br>
No other noyse, nor peoples troublous cryes,</br>
As still are wont t'annoy the walled towne,</br>
Might there be heard: but carelesse Quiet lyes,</br>
Wrapt in eternall silence farre from enemyes.</br>
</br>
xlii</br>
The messenger approching to him spake,</br>
But his wast wordes returnd to him in vaine:</br>
So sound he slept, that nought mought him awake.</br>
Then rudely he him thrust, and pusht with paine,</br>
Whereat he gan to stretch: but he againe</br>
Shooke him so hard, that forced him to speake.</br>
As one then in a dreame, whose dryer braine</br>
In tost with troubled sights and fancies weake,</br>
He mumbled soft, but would not all his silence breake.</br>
</br>
xliii</br>
The Sprite then gan more boldly him to wake,</br>
And threatned unto him the dreaded name</br>
Of Hecate: whereat he gan to quake,</br>
And lifting up his lumpish head, with blame</br>
Halfe angry asked him, for what he came.</br>
Hither (quoth he) me Archimago sent,</br>
He that the stubborne Sprites can wisely tame,</br>
He bids thee to him send for his intent</br>
A fit false dreame, that can delude the sleepers sent.</br>
</br>
xliv</br>
The God obayde, and calling forth straight way</br>
A diverse dreame out of his prison darke,</br>
Delivered it to him, and downe did lay</br>
His heavie head, devoide of carefull carke,</br>
Whose sences all were straight benumbed and starke.</br>
He backe returning by the Yvorie dore,</br>
Remounted up as light as chearefull Larke,</br>
And on his litle winges the dreame he bore</br>
In hast unto his Lord, where he him left afore.</br>
</br>
xlv</br>
Who all this while with charmes and hidden artes,</br>
Had made a Lady of that other Spright,</br>
And fram'd of liquid ayre her tender partes</br>
So lively, and so like in all mens sight,</br>
That weaker sence it could have ravisht quight:</br>
The maker selfe for all his wondrous witt,</br>
Was nigh beguiled with so goodly sight:</br>
Her all in white he clad, and over it</br>
Cast a blacke stole, most like to seeme for Una fit.</br>
</br>
xlvi</br>
Now when that ydle dreame was to him brought,</br>
Unto that Elfin knight he bad him fly,</br>
Where he slept soundly void of evill thought</br>
And with false shewes abuse his fantasy,</br>
In sort as he him schooled privily:</br>
And that new creature borne without her dew,</br>
Full of the makers guile, with usage sly</br>
He taught to imitate that Lady trew,</br>
Whose semblance she did carrie under feigned hew.</br>
</br>
xlvii</br>
Thus well instructed, to their worke they hast,</br>
And comming where the knight in slomber lay,</br>
The one upon his hardy head him plast,</br>
And made him dreame of loves and lustfull play,</br>
That nigh his manly hart did melt away,</br>
Bathed in wanton blis and wicked joy:</br>
Then seemed him his Lady by him lay,</br>
And to him playnd, how that false winged boy,</br>
Her chast hart had subdewd, to learne Dame pleasures toy.</br>
</br>
xlviii</br>
And she her selfe of beautie soveraigne Queene,</br>
Faire Venus seemde unto his bed to bring</br>
Her, whom he waking evermore did weene,</br>
To be the chastest flowre, that ay did spring</br>
On earthly braunch, the daughter of a king,</br>
Now a loose Leman to vile service bound:</br>
And eke the Graces seemed all to sing,</br>
Hymen {i}{_o} Hymen, dauncing all around,</br>
While freshest Flora her with Yvie girlond crownd.</br>
</br>
xlix</br>
In this great passion of unwonted lust,</br>
Or wonted feare of doing ought amis,</br>
He started up, as seeming to mistrust</br>
Some secret ill, or hidden foe of his:</br>
Lo there before his face his Lady is,</br>
Under blake stole hyding her bayted hooke,</br>
And as halfe blushing offred him to kis,</br>
With gentle blandishment and lovely looke,</br>
Most like that virgin true, which for her knight him took.</br>
</br>
l</br>
All cleane dismayd to see so uncouth sight,</br>
And halfe enraged at her shamelesse guise,</br>
He thought have slaine her in his fierce despight:</br>
But hasty heat tempring with sufferance wise,</br>
He stayde his hand, and gan himselfe advise</br>
To prove his sense, and tempt her faigned truth.</br>
Wringing her hands in wemens pitteous wise,</br>
Tho can she weepe, to stirre up gentle ruth,</br>
Both for her noble bloud, and for her tender youth.</br>
</br>
li</br>
And said, Ah Sir, my liege Lord and my love,</br>
Shall I accuse the hidden cruell fate,</br>
And mightie causes wrought in heaven above,</br>
Or the blind God, that doth me thus amate,</br>
For hoped love to winne me certaine hate?</br>
Yet thus perforce he bids me do, or die.</br>
Die is my dew: yet rew my wretched state</br>
You, whom my hard avenging destinie</br>
Hath made judge of my life or death indifferently.</br>
</br>
lii</br>
Your owne deare sake forst me at first to leave</br>
My Fathers kingdome, There she stopt with teares;</br>
Her swollen hart her speach seemd to bereave,</br>
And then againe begun, My weaker yeares</br>
Captiv'd to fortune and frayle worldly feares,</br>
Fly to your faith for succour and sure ayde:</br>
Let me not dye in languor and long teares.</br>
Why Dame (quoth he) what hath ye thus dismayd?</br>
What frayes ye, that were wont to comfort me affrayd?</br>
</br>
liii</br>
Love of your selfe, she said, and deare constraint</br>
Lets me not sleepe, but wast the wearie night</br>
In secret anguish and unpittied plaint,</br>
Whiles you in carelesse sleepe are drowned quight.</br>
Her doubtfull words made that redoubted knight</br>
Suspect her truth: yet since no'untruth he knew,</br>
Her fawning love with foule disdainefull spight</br>
He would not shend, but said, Deare dame I rew,</br>
That for my sake unknowne such griefe unto you grew.</br>
</br>
liv</br>
Assure your selfe, it fell not all to ground;</br>
For all so deare as life is to my hart,</br>
I deeme your love, and hold me to you bound;</br>
Ne let vaine feares procure your needlesse smart,</br>
Where cause is none, but to your rest depart.</br>
Not all content, yet seemd she to appease</br>
Her mournefull plaintes, beguiled of her art,</br>
And fed with words, that could not chuse but please,</br>
So slyding softly forth, she turnd as to her ease.</br>
</br>
lv</br>
Long after lay he musing at her mood,</br>
Much griev'd to think that gentle Dame so light,</br>
For whose defence he was to shed his blood.</br>
At last dull wearinesse of former fight</br>
Having yrockt a sleepe his irkesome spright,</br>
That troublous dreame gan freshly tosse his braine,</br>
With bowres, and beds, and Ladies deare delight:</br>
But when he saw his labour all was vaine,</br>
With that misformed spright he backe returnd againe.</br>
