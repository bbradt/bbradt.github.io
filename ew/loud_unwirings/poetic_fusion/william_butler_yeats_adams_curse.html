                        <h3>By: WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS</h3>
                        <p ">
We sat together at one summers end,</br>
That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,   </br>
And you and I, and talked of poetry.</br>
I said, A line will take us hours maybe;</br>
Yet if it does not seem a moments thought,   </br>
Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.   </br>
Better go down upon your marrow-bones   </br>
And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones   </br>
Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;   </br>
For to articulate sweet sounds together</br>
Is to work harder than all these, and yet   </br>
Be thought an idler by the noisy set</br>
Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen   </br>
The martyrs call the world.</br>
                                          And thereupon</br>
That beautiful mild woman for whose sake   </br>
Theres many a one shall find out all heartache   </br>
On finding that her voice is sweet and low   </br>
Replied, To be born woman is to know</br>
Although they do not talk of it at school</br>
That we must labour to be beautiful.</br>
I said, Its certain there is no fine thing   </br>
Since Adams fall but needs much labouring.</br>
There have been lovers who thought love should be   </br>
So much compounded of high courtesy   </br>
That they would sigh and quote with learned looks   </br>
Precedents out of beautiful old books;   </br>
Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.</br>
</br>
We sat grown quiet at the name of love;   </br>
We saw the last embers of daylight die,   </br>
And in the trembling blue-green of the sky   </br>
A moon, worn as if it had been a shell   </br>
Washed by times waters as they rose and fell   </br>
About the stars and broke in days and years.</br>
</br>
I had a thought for no ones but your ears:   </br>
That you were beautiful, and that I strove   </br>
To love you in the old high way of love;</br>
That it had all seemed happy, and yet wed grown   </br>
As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.</br>
