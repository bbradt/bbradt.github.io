                        <h3>By: EZRA POUND</h3>
                        <p ">
While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead</br>
I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.</br>
You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,</br>
You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.</br>
And we went on living in the village of Chokan:</br>
Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.</br>
At fourteen I married My Lord you.</br>
I never laughed, being bashful.</br>
Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.</br>
Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.</br>
</br>
At fifteen I stopped scowling,</br>
I desired my dust to be mingled with yours</br>
Forever and forever, and forever.</br>
Why should I climb the look out?</br>
</br>
At sixteen you departed</br>
You went into far Ku-to-en, by the river of swirling eddies,</br>
And you have been gone five months.</br>
The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.</br>
</br>
You dragged your feet when you went out.</br>
By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,</br>
Too deep to clear them away!</br>
The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind.</br>
The paired butterflies are already yellow with August</br>
Over the grass in the West garden;</br>
They hurt me.</br>
I grow older.</br>
If you are coming down through the narrows of the river Kiang,</br>
Please let me know beforehand,</br>
And I will come out to meet you</br>
As far as Cho-fu-Sa.</br>
