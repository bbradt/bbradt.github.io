                        <h2>Of the Mean and Sure Estate</h2>
                        <h3>By: SIR THOMAS WYATT</h3>
                        <p ">
My mother's maids, when they did sew and spin,</br>
They sang sometime a song of the field mouse,</br>
That, for because her livelood was but thin,</br>
</br>
Would needs go seek her townish sister's house.</br>
She thought herself endured too much pain;</br>
The stormy blasts her cave so sore did souse</br>
</br>
That when the furrows swimmed with the rain,</br>
She must lie cold and wet in sorry plight;</br>
And worse than that, bare meat there did remain</br>
</br>
To comfort her when she her house had dight;</br>
Sometime a barley corn; sometime a bean;</br>
For which she laboured hard both day and night</br>
</br>
In harvest time whilst she might go and glean;</br>
And where store was stroyed with the flood,</br>
Then well away! for she undone was clean.</br>
</br>
Then was she fain to take instead of food</br>
Sleep, if she might, her hunger to beguile.</br>
\"My sister,\ " quod she, \"hath a living good,</br>
                            </br>
                            And hence from me she dwelleth not a mile.</br>
                            In cold and storm she lieth warm and dry</br>
                            In bed of down; the dirt doth not defile</br>
                            </br>
                            Her tender foot, she laboureth not as I.</br>
                            Richly she feedeth and at the richman's cost,</br>
                            And for her meat she needs not crave nor cry.</br>
                            </br>
                            By sea, by land, of the delicates, the most</br>
                            Her cater seeks, and spareth for no peril.</br>
                            She feedeth on boiled bacon meet and roast,</br>
                            </br>
                            And hath thereof neither charge nor travail;</br>
                            And when she list, the liquor of the grape</br>
                            Doth glad her heart till that her belly swell.\"</br>
                            </br>
                            And at this journey she maketh but a jape;</br>
                            So forth she goeth, trusting of all this wealth</br>
                            With her sister her part so for to shape,</br>
                            </br>
                            That if she might keep herself in health,</br>
                            To live a lady while her life doth last.</br>
                            And to the door now is she come by stealth,</br>
                            </br>
                            And with her foot anon she scrapeth full fast.</br>
                            Th' other for fear durst not well scarce appear,</br>
                            Of every noise so was the wretch aghast.</br>
                            </br>
                            At last she asked softly who was there.</br>
                            And in her language, as well as she could,</br>
                            \"Peep!\" quod the other. \"Sister, I am here.\"</br>
                            </br>
                            \"Peace,\" quod the towny mouse, \"why speakest thou so loud?\"</br>
                            And by the hand she took her fair and well.</br>
                            \"Welcome,\" quod she, \"my sister, by the Rood!\"</br>
                            </br>
                            She feasted her, that joy it was to tell</br>
                            The fare they had; they drank the wine so clear,</br>
                            And as to purpose now and then it fell,</br>
                            </br>
                            She cheered her with \"How, sister, what cheer!\"</br>
                            Amids this joy befell a sorry chance,</br>
                            That, well away! the stranger bought full dear</br>
                            </br>
                            The fare she had, for, as she look askance,</br>
                            Under a stool she spied two steaming eyes</br>
                            In a round head with sharp ears. In France</br>
                            </br>
                            Was never mouse so fear'd, for the unwise</br>
                            Had not i-seen such a beast before,</br>
                            Yet had nature taught her after her guise</br>
                            </br>
                            To know her foe and dread him evermore.</br>
                            The towny mouse fled, she know whither to go;</br>
                            Th' other had no shift, but wonders sore</br>
                            </br>
                            Feard of her life. At home she wished her tho,</br>
                            And to the door, alas! as she did skip,</br>
                            The Heaven it would, lo! and eke her chance was so,</br>
                            </br>
                            At the threshold her silly foot did trip;</br>
                            And ere she might recover it again,</br>
                            The traitor cat had caught her by the hip,</br>
                            </br>
                            And made her there against her will remain,</br>
                            That had forgotten her poor surety and rest</br>
                            For seeming wealth wherein she thought to reign.</br>
                            </br>
                            Alas, my Poynz, how men do seek the best</br>
                            And find the worst, by error as they stray!</br>
                            And no marvail; when sight is so opprest.</br>
                            </br>
                            And blind the guide; anon out of the way</br>
                            Goeth guide and all in seeking quiet life.</br>
                            O wretched minds, there is no gold that may</br>
                            </br>
                            Grant that ye seek; no war, no peace, no strife.</br>
                            No, no, although thy head were hooped with gold,</br>
                            Sergeant with mace, hawbert, sword, nor knife,</br>
                            </br>
                            Cannot repulse the care that follow should.</br>
                            Each kind of life hath with him his disease.</br>
                            Live in delight even as thy lust would,</br>
                            </br>
                            And thou shalt find, when lust doth most thee please,</br>
                            It irketh straight and by itself doth fade.</br>
                            A small thing it is that may thy mind appease.</br>
                            </br>
                            None of ye all there is that is so mad</br>
                            To seek grapes upon brambles or breres;</br>
                            Nor none, I trow, that hath his wit so bad</br>
                            </br>
                            To set his hay for conies over rivers,</br>
                            Ne ye set not a drag-net for an hare;</br>
                            And yet the thing that most is your desire</br>
                            </br>
                            Ye do mis-seek with more travail and care.</br>
                            Make plain thine heart, that it be not knotted</br>
                            With hope or dread, and see thy will be bare</br>
                            </br>
                            From all affects, whom vice hath ever spotted.</br>
                            Thyself content with that is thee assigned,</br>
                            And use it well that is to thee allotted.</br>
                            </br>
                            Then seek no more out of thyself to find</br>
                            The thing that thou hast sought so long before,</br>
                            For thou shalt feel it sitting in thy mind.</br>
                            </br>
                            Mad, if ye list to continue your sore,</br>
                            Let present pass and gape on time to come,</br>
                            And deep yourself in travail more and more.</br>
                            </br>
                            Henceforth, my Poynz, this shall be all and some,</br>
                            These wretched fools shall have nought else of me;</br>
                            But to the great God and to his high doom,</br>
                            </br>
                            None other pain pray I for them to be,</br>
                            But when the rage doth lead them from the right,</br>
                            That, looking backward, Virtue they may see,</br>
                            </br>
                            Even as she is, so goodly fair and bright;</br>
                            And whilst they clasp their lusts in arms across,</br>
                            Grant them, good Lord, as Thou mayst of Thy might</br>
                            To fret inward for losing such a loss.</br>
