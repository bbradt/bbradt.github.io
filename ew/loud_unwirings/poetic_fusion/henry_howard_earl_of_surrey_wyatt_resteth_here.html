                        <h2>Wyatt Resteth Here</h2>
                        <h3>By: HENRY HOWARD, EARL OF SURREY</h3>
                        <p ">
Wyatt resteth here, that quick could never rest;</br>
Whose heavenly gifts increased by disdain,</br>
And virtue sank the deeper in his breast;</br>
Such profit he of envy could obtain.</br>
</br>
A head, where wisdom mysteries did frame,</br>
Whose hammers beat still in that lively brain</br>
As on a stith, where some work of fame</br>
Was daily wrought, to turn to Britains gain.</br>
</br>
A visage, stern and mild; where both did grow,</br>
Vice to condemn, in virtues to rejoice;</br>
Amid great storms whom grace assured so,</br>
To live upright and smile at fortunes choice.</br>
</br>
A hand that taught what might be said in rhyme;</br>
That reft Chaucer the glory of his wit;</br>
A mark the which (unperfited, for time)</br>
Some may approach, but never none shall hit.</br>
</br>
A tongue that served in foreign realms his king;</br>
Whose courteous talk to virtue did enflame</br>
Each noble heart; a worthy guide to bring</br>
Our English youth, by travail unto fame.</br>
</br>
An eye whose judgment no affect could blind,</br>
Friends to allure, and foes to reconcile;</br>
Whose piercing look did represent a mind</br>
With virtue fraught, reposed, void of guile.</br>
</br>
A heart where dread yet never so impressed</br>
To hide the thought that might the truth avaunce;</br>
In neither fortune lift, nor so repressed,</br>
To swell in wealth, nor yield unto mischance.</br>
</br>
A valiant corps, where force and beauty met,</br>
Happy, alas! too happy, but for foes,</br>
Lived, and ran the race that nature set;</br>
Of manhoods shape, where she the mold did lose.</br>
</br>
But to the heavens that simple soul is fled,</br>
Which left with such, as covet Christ to know</br>
Witness of faith that never shall be dead:</br>
Sent for our health, but not received so.</br>
</br>
Thus, for our guilt, this jewel have we lost;</br>
The earth his bones, the heavens possess his ghost.</br>
Amen.</br>
