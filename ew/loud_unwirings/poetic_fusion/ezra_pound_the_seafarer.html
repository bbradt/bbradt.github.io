                        <h3>By: EZRA POUND</h3>
                        <p ">
May I for my own self song's truth reckon,</br>
Journey's jargon, how I in harsh days</br>
Hardship endured oft.</br>
Bitter breast-cares have I abided,</br>
Known on my keel many a care's hold,</br>
And dire sea-surge, and there I oft spent</br>
Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship's head</br>
While she tossed close to cliffs. Coldly afflicted,</br>
My feet were by frost benumbed.</br>
Chill its chains are; chafing sighs</br>
Hew my heart round and hunger begot</br>
Mere-weary mood. Lest man know not</br>
That he on dry land loveliest liveth,</br>
List how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea,</br>
Weathered the winter, wretched outcast</br>
Deprived of my kinsmen;</br>
Hung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew,</br>
There I heard naught save the harsh sea</br>
And ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries,</br>
Did for my games the gannet's clamour,</br>
Sea-fowls, loudness was for me laughter,</br>
The mews' singing all my mead-drink.</br>
Storms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern</br>
In icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed</br>
With spray on his pinion.</br>
Not any protector</br>
May make merry man faring needy.</br>
This he little believes, who aye in winsome life</br>
Abides 'mid burghers some heavy business,</br>
Wealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft</br>
Must bide above brine.</br>
Neareth nightshade, snoweth from north,</br>
Frost froze the land, hail fell on earth then</br>
Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now</br>
The heart's thought that I on high streams</br>
The salt-wavy tumult traverse alone.</br>
Moaneth alway my mind's lust</br>
That I fare forth, that I afar hence</br>
Seek out a foreign fastness.</br>
For this there's no mood-lofty man over earth's midst,</br>
Not though he be given his good, but will have in his youth greed;</br>
Nor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful</br>
But shall have his sorrow for sea-fare</br>
Whatever his lord will.</br>
He hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having</br>
Nor winsomeness to wife, nor world's delight</br>
Nor any whit else save the wave's slash,</br>
Yet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water.</br>
Bosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries,</br>
Fields to fairness, land fares brisker,</br>
All this admonisheth man eager of mood,</br>
The heart turns to travel so that he then thinks</br>
On flood-ways to be far departing.</br>
Cuckoo calleth with gloomy crying,</br>
He singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow,</br>
The bitter heart's blood. Burgher knows not </br>
He the prosperous man  what some perform</br>
Where wandering them widest draweth.</br>
So that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock,</br>
My mood 'mid the mere-flood,</br>
Over the whale's acre, would wander wide.</br>
On earth's shelter cometh oft to me,</br>
Eager and ready, the crying lone-flyer,</br>
Whets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly,</br>
O'er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow</br>
My lord deems to me this dead life</br>
On loan and on land, I believe not</br>
That any earth-weal eternal standeth</br>
Save there be somewhat calamitous</br>
That, ere a man's tide go, turn it to twain.</br>
Disease or oldness or sword-hate</br>
Beats out the breath from doom-gripped body.</br>
And for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after </br>
Laud of the living, boasteth some last word,</br>
That he will work ere he pass onward,</br>
Frame on the fair earth 'gainst foes his malice,</br>
Daring ado, ...</br>
So that all men shall honour him after</br>
And his laud beyond them remain 'mid the English,</br>
Aye, for ever, a lasting life's-blast,</br>
Delight mid the doughty.</br>
Days little durable,</br>
And all arrogance of earthen riches,</br>
There come now no kings nor Csars</br>
Nor gold-giving lords like those gone.</br>
Howe'er in mirth most magnified,</br>
Whoe'er lived in life most lordliest,</br>
Drear all this excellence, delights undurable!</br>
Waneth the watch, but the world holdeth.</br>
Tomb hideth trouble. The blade is layed low.</br>
Earthly glory ageth and seareth.</br>
No man at all going the earth's gait,</br>
But age fares against him, his face paleth,</br>
Grey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions,</br>
Lordly men are to earth o'ergiven,</br>
Nor may he then the flesh-cover, whose life ceaseth,</br>
Nor eat the sweet nor feel the sorry,</br>
Nor stir hand nor think in mid heart,</br>
And though he strew the grave with gold,</br>
His born brothers, their buried bodies</br>
Be an unlikely treasure hoard.</br>
