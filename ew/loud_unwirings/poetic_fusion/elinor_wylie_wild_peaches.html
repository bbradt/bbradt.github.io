                        <h2>Wild Peaches</h2>
                        <h3>By: ELINOR WYLIE</h3>
                        <p ">
                                  1 </br>
</br>
When the world turns completely upside down</br>
You say well emigrate to the Eastern Shore</br>
Aboard a river-boat from Baltimore;</br>
Well live among wild peach trees, miles from town,</br>
Youll wear a coonskin cap, and I a gown</br>
Homespun, dyed butternuts dark gold color.</br>
Lost, like your lotus-eating ancestor,</br>
Well swim in milk and honey till we drown.</br>
</br>
The winter will be short, the summer long,</br>
The autumn amber-hued, sunny and hot,</br>
Tasting of cider and of scuppernong;</br>
All seasons sweet, but autumn best of all.</br>
The squirrels in their silver fur will fall</br>
Like falling leaves, like fruit, before your shot.</br>
</br>
</br>
                                  2 </br>
</br>
The autumn frosts will lie upon the grass</br>
Like bloom on grapes of purple-brown and gold.</br>
The misted early mornings will be cold;</br>
The little puddles will be roofed with glass.</br>
The sun, which burns from copper into brass,</br>
Melts these at noon, and makes the boys unfold</br>
Their knitted mufflers; full as they can hold</br>
Fat pockets dribble chestnuts as they pass.</br>
</br>
Peaches grow wild, and pigs can live in clover;</br>
A barrel of salted herrings lasts a year;</br>
The spring begins before the winters over.</br>
By February you may find the skins</br>
Of garter snakes and water moccasins</br>
Dwindled and harsh, dead-white and cloudy-clear.</br>
</br>
</br>
                                  3 </br>
</br>
When April pours the colors of a shell</br>
Upon the hills, when every little creek</br>
Is shot with silver from the Chesapeake</br>
In shoals new-minted by the ocean swell,</br>
When strawberries go begging, and the sleek</br>
Blue plums lie open to the blackbirds beak,</br>
We shall live well  we shall live very well.</br>
</br>
The months between the cherries and the peaches</br>
Are brimming cornucopias which spill</br>
Fruits red and purple, sombre-bloomed and black;</br>
Then, down rich fields and frosty river beaches</br>
Well trample bright persimmons, while you kill</br>
Bronze partridge, speckled quail, and canvasback.</br>
</br>
</br>
                                  4 </br>
</br>
Down to the Puritan marrow of my bones</br>
Theres something in this richness that I hate.</br>
I love the look, austere, immaculate,</br>
Of landscapes drawn in pearly monotones.</br>
Theres something in my very blood that owns</br>
Bare hills, cold silver on a sky of slate,</br>
A thread of water, churned to milky spate</br>
Streaming through slanted pastures fenced with stones.</br>
</br>
I love those skies, thin blue or snowy gray,</br>
Those fields sparse-planted, rendering meagre sheaves;</br>
That spring, briefer than apple-blossoms breath,</br>
Summer, so much too beautiful to stay,</br>
Swift autumn, like a bonfire of leaves,</br>
And sleepy winter, like the sleep of death.</br>
