                        <h3>By: JOHN DONNE</h3>
                        <p ">
No spring nor summer beauty hath such grace</br>
         As I have seen in one autumnal face.</br>
Young beauties force our love, and that's a rape,</br>
         This doth but counsel, yet you cannot scape.</br>
If 'twere a shame to love, here 'twere no shame;</br>
         Affection here takes reverence's name.</br>
Were her first years the golden age? That's true,</br>
         But now she's gold oft tried and ever new.</br>
That was her torrid and inflaming time,</br>
         This is her tolerable tropic clime.</br>
Fair eyes, who asks more heat than comes from hence,</br>
         He in a fever wishes pestilence.</br>
Call not these wrinkles, graves; if graves they were,</br>
         They were Love's graves, for else he is no where.</br>
Yet lies not Love dead here, but here doth sit</br>
         Vow'd to this trench, like an anachorit;</br>
And here till hers, which must be his death, come,</br>
         He doth not dig a grave, but build a tomb.</br>
Here dwells he; though he sojourn ev'rywhere</br>
         In progress, yet his standing house is here:</br>
Here where still evening is, not noon nor night,</br>
         Where no voluptuousness, yet all delight.</br>
In all her words, unto all hearers fit,</br>
         You may at revels, you at council, sit.</br>
This is Love's timber, youth his underwood;</br>
         There he, as wine in June, enrages blood,</br>
Which then comes seasonabliest when our taste</br>
         And appetite to other things is past.</br>
Xerxes' strange Lydian love, the platan tree,</br>
         Was lov'd for age, none being so large as she,</br>
Or else because, being young, nature did bless</br>
         Her youth with age's glory, barrenness.</br>
If we love things long sought, age is a thing</br>
         Which we are fifty years in compassing;</br>
If transitory things, which soon decay,</br>
         Age must be loveliest at the latest day.</br>
But name not winter faces, whose skin's slack,</br>
         Lank as an unthrift's purse, but a soul's sack;</br>
Whose eyes seek light within, for all here's shade;</br>
         Whose mouths are holes, rather worn out than made;</br>
Whose every tooth to a several place is gone,</br>
         To vex their souls at resurrection:</br>
Name not these living death's-heads unto me,</br>
         For these, not ancient, but antique be.</br>
I hate extremes, yet I had rather stay</br>
         With tombs than cradles, to wear out a day.</br>
Since such love's natural lation is, may still</br>
         My love descend, and journey down the hill,</br>
Not panting after growing beauties. So,</br>
         I shall ebb on with them who homeward go.</br>
