                        <h3>By: JOHN DONNE</h3>
                        <p ">
Forget this rotten world, and unto thee</br>
Let thine own times as an old story be.</br>
Be not concern'd; study not why, nor when;</br>
Do not so much as not believe a man.</br>
For though to err, be worst, to try truths forth</br>
Is far more business than this world is worth.</br>
I'he world is but a carcass; thou art fed</br>
By it, but as a worm, that carcass bred;</br>
And why shouldst thou, poor worm, consider more,</br>
When this world will grow better than before,</br>
Than those thy fellow-worms do think upon</br>
That carcass's last resurrection?</br>
Forget this world, and scarce think of it so,</br>
As of old clothes, cast off a year ago.</br>
To be thus stupid is alacrity;</br>
Men thus lethargic have best memory.</br>
Look upward; that's towards her, whose happy state</br>
We now lament not, but congratulate.</br>
She, to whom all this world was but a stage,</br>
Where all sat heark'ning how her youthful age</br>
Should be employ'd, because in all she did</br>
Some figure of the golden times was hid.</br>
Who could not lack, what'er this world could give,</br>
Because she was the form, that made it live;</br>
Nor could complain that this world was unfit</br>
To be stay'd in, then when she was in it;</br>
She, that first tried indifferent desires</br>
By virtue, and virtue by religious fires;</br>
She, to whose person paradise adher'd,</br>
As courts to princes; she, whose eyes enspher'd</br>
Star-light enough t' have made the South control,</br>
(Had she been there) the star-full Northern Pole;</br>
She, she is gone; she is gone; when thou knowest this,</br>
What fragmentary rubbish this world is</br>
Thou knowest, and that it is not worth a thought;</br>
He honours it too much that thinks it nought.</br>
Think then, my soul, that death is but a groom,</br>
Which brings a taper to the outward room,</br>
Whence thou spiest first a little glimmering light,</br>
And after brings it nearer to thy sight;</br>
For such approaches doth heaven make in death.</br>
Think thyself labouring now with broken breath,</br>
And think those broken and soft notes to be</br>
Division, and thy happiest harmony.</br>
Think thee laid on thy death-bed, loose and slack,</br>
And think that but unbinding of a pack,</br>
To take one precious thing, thy soul, from thence.</br>
Think thyself parch'd with fever's violence;</br>
Anger thine ague more, by calling it</br>
Thy physic; chide the slackness of the fit.</br>
Think that thou hear'st thy knell, and think no more,</br>
But that, as bells call'd thee to church before,</br>
So this to the Triumphant Church calls thee.</br>
Think Satan's sergeants round about thee be,</br>
And think that but for legacies they thrust;</br>
Give one thy pride, to'another give thy lust;</br>
Give them those sins which they gave thee before,</br>
And trust th' immaculate blood to wash thy score.</br>
Think thy friends weeping round, and think that they</br>
Weep but because they go not yet thy way.</br>
Think that they close thine eyes, and think in this,</br>
That they confess much in the world amiss,</br>
Who dare not trust a dead man's eye with that</br>
Which they from God and angels cover not.</br>
Think that they shroud thee up, and think from thence</br>
They reinvest thee in white innocence.</br>
Think that thy body rots, and (if so low,</br>
Thy soul exalted so, thy thoughts can go)</br>
Think thee a prince, who of themselves create</br>
Worms, which insensibly devour their state.</br>
Think that they bury thee, and think that rite</br>
Lays thee to sleep but a Saint Lucy's night.</br>
