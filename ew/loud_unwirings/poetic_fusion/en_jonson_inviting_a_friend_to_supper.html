<h2>Inviting a Friend to Supper</h2>
<h3>By: EN JONSON</h3>
<p">
Tonight, grave sir, both my poor house, and I</br>
Do equally desire your company;</br>
Not that we think us worthy such a guest,</br>
But that your worth will dignify our feast</br>
With those that come, whose grace may make that seem</br>
Something, which else could hope for no esteem.</br>
It is the fair acceptance, sir, creates</br>
The entertainment perfect, not the cates.</br>
Yet shall you have, to rectify your palate,</br>
An olive, capers, or some better salad</br>
Ushering the mutton; with a short-legged hen,</br>
If we can get her, full of eggs, and then</br>
Lemons, and wine for sauce; to these a cony</br>
Is not to be despaired of, for our money;</br>
And, though fowl now be scarce, yet there are clerks,</br>
The sky not falling, think we may have larks.</br>
Ill tell you of more, and lie, so you will come:</br>
Of partridge, pheasant, woodcock, of which some</br>
May yet be there, and godwit, if we can;</br>
Knat, rail, and ruff too. Howsoeer, my man</br>
Shall read a piece of Virgil, Tacitus,</br>
Livy, or of some better book to us,</br>
Of which well speak our minds, amidst our meat;</br>
And Ill profess no verses to repeat.</br>
To this, if ought appear which I not know of,</br>
That will the pastry, not my paper, show of.</br>
Digestive cheese and fruit there sure will be;</br>
But that which most doth take my Muse and me,</br>
Is a pure cup of rich Canary wine,</br>
Which is the Mermaids now, but shall be mine;</br>
Of which had Horace, or Anacreon tasted,</br>
Their lives, as so their lines, till now had lasted.</br>
Tobacco, nectar, or the Thespian spring,</br>
Are all but Luther's beer to this I sing.</br>
Of this we will sup free, but moderately,</br>
And we will have no Pooley, or Parrot by,</br>
Nor shall our cups make any guilty men;</br>
But, at our parting we will be as when</br>
We innocently met. No simple word</br>
That shall be uttered at our mirthful board,</br>
Shall make us sad next morning or affright</br>
The liberty that well enjoy tonight.</br>
