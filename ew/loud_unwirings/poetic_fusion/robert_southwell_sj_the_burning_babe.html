                        <h2>The Burning Babe</h2>
                        <h3>By: ROBERT SOUTHWELL, SJ</h3>
                        <p ">
As I in hoary winters night stood shivering in the snow,</br>
Surprisd I was with sudden heat which made my heart to glow;</br>
And lifting up a fearful eye to view what fire was near,</br>
A pretty Babe all burning bright did in the air appear;</br>
Who, scorched with excessive heat, such floods of tears did shed</br>
As though his floods should quench his flames which with his tears were fed.</br>
Alas! quoth he, but newly born, in fiery heats I fry,</br>
Yet none approach to warm their hearts or feel my fire but I!</br>
My faultless breast the furnace is, the fuel wounding thorns,</br>
Love is the fire, and sighs the smoke, the ashes shame and scorns;</br>
The fuel Justice layeth on, and Mercy blows the coals,</br>
The metal in this furnace wrought are mens defiled souls,</br>
For which, as now on fire I am to work them to their good,</br>
      So will I melt into a bath to wash them in my blood.</br>
      With this he vanishd out of sight and swiftly shrunk away,</br>
      And straight I called unto mind that it was Christmas day.</br>
