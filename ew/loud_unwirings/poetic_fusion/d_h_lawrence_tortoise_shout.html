                        <h2>Tortoise Shout</h2>
                        <h3>By: D. H. LAWRENCE</h3>
                        <p ">
I thought he was dumb,</br>
I said he was dumb,</br>
Yet I've heard him cry.</br>
</br>
First faint scream,</br>
Out of life's unfathomable dawn,</br>
Far off, so far, like a madness, under the horizon's dawning rim,</br>
Far, far off, far scream.</br>
</br>
Tortoise in extremis.</br>
</br>
Why were we crucified into sex?</br>
Why were we not left rounded off, and finished in ourselves,</br>
As we began,</br>
As he certainly began, so perfectly alone?</br>
</br>
A far, was-it-audible scream,</br>
Or did it sound on the plasm direct?</br>
</br>
Worse than the cry of the new-born,</br>
A scream,</br>
A yell,</br>
A shout,</br>
A pan,</br>
A death-agony,</br>
A birth-cry,</br>
A submission,</br>
All tiny, tiny, far away, reptile under the first dawn.</br>
</br>
War-cry, triumph, acute-delight, death-scream reptilian,</br>
Why was the veil torn?</br>
The silken shriek of the soul's torn membrane?</br>
The male soul's membrane</br>
Torn with a shriek half music, half horror.</br>
</br>
Crucifixion.</br>
Male tortoise, cleaving behind the hovel-wall of that dense female,</br>
Mounted and tense, spread-eagle, out-reaching out of the shell</br>
In tortoise-nakedness,</br>
Long neck, and long vulnerable limbs extruded, spread-eagle over her house-roof,</br>
And the deep, secret, all-penetrating tail curved beneath her walls,</br>
Reaching and gripping tense, more reaching anguish in uttermost tension</br>
Till suddenly, in the spasm of coition, tupping like a jerking leap, and oh!</br>
Opening its clenched face from his outstretched neck</br>
And giving that fragile yell, that scream,</br>
Super-audible,</br>
From his pink, cleft, old-man's mouth,</br>
Giving up the ghost,</br>
Or screaming in Pentecost, receiving the ghost.</br>
</br>
His scream, and his moment's subsidence,</br>
The moment of eternal silence,</br>
Yet unreleased, and after the moment, the sudden, startling jerk of coition, and at once</br>
The inexpressible faint yell </br>
And so on, till the last plasm of my body was melted back</br>
To the primeval rudiments of life, and the secret.</br>
</br>
So he tups, and screams</br>
Time after time that frail, torn scream</br>
After each jerk, the longish interval,</br>
The tortoise eternity,</br>
Agelong, reptilian persistence,</br>
Heart-throb, slow heart-throb, persistent for the next spasm.</br>
</br>
I remember, when I was a boy,</br>
I heard the scream of a frog, which was caught with his foot in the mouth of an up-starting snake;</br>
I remember when I first heard bull-frogs break into sound in the spring;</br>
I remember hearing a wild goose out of the throat of night</br>
Cry loudly, beyond the lake of waters;</br>
I remember the first time, out of a bush in the darkness, a nightingale's piercing cries and gurgles startled the depths of my soul;</br>
I remember the scream of a rabbit as I went through a wood at midnight;</br>
I remember the heifer in her heat, blorting and blorting through the hours, persistent and irrepressible;</br>
I remember my first terror hearing the howl of weird, amorous cats;</br>
I remember the scream of a terrified, injured horse, the sheet-lightning</br>
And running away from the sound of a woman in labor, something like an owl whooing,</br>
And listening inwardly to the first bleat of a lamb,</br>
The first wail of an infant,</br>
And my mother singing to herself,</br>
And the first tenor singing of the passionate throat of a young collier, who has long since drunk himself to death,</br>
The first elements of foreign speech</br>
On wild dark lips.</br>
</br>
And more than all these,</br>
And less than all these,</br>
This last,</br>
Strange, faint coition yell</br>
Of the male tortoise at extremity,</br>
Tiny from under the very edge of the farthest far-off horizon of life.</br>
</br>
The cross,</br>
The wheel on which our silence first is broken,</br>
Sex, which breaks up our integrity, our single inviolability, our deep silence</br>
Tearing a cry from us.</br>
</br>
Sex, which breaks us into voice, sets us calling across the deeps, calling, calling for the complement,</br>
Singing, and calling, and singing again, being answered, having found.</br>
</br>
Torn, to become whole again, after long seeking for what is lost,</br>
The same cry from the tortoise as from Christ, the Osiris-cry of abandonment,</br>
That which is whole, torn asunder,</br>
That which is in part, finding its whole again throughout the universe.</br>
