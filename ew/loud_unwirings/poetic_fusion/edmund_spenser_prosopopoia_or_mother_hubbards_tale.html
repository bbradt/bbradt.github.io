                        <h3>By: EDMUND SPENSER</h3>
                        <p ">
By that he ended had his ghostly sermon,</br>
The fox was well induc'd to be a parson,</br>
And of the priest eftsoons gan to inquire,</br>
How to a benefice he might aspire.</br>
\"Marry, there\ " (said the priest) \"is art indeed:</br>
                            Much good deep learning one thereout may read;</br>
                            For that the ground-work is, and end of all,</br>
                            How to obtain a beneficial.</br>
                            First, therefore, when ye have in handsome wise</br>
                            Yourself attired, as you can devise,</br>
                            Then to some nobleman yourself apply,</br>
                            Or other great one in the worldes eye,</br>
                            That hath a zealous disposition</br>
                            To God, and so to his religion.</br>
                            There must thou fashion eke a godly zeal,</br>
                            Such as no carpers may contrare reveal;</br>
                            For each thing feigned ought more wary be.</br>
                            There thou must walk in sober gravity,</br>
                            And seem as saint-like as Saint Radegund:</br>
                            Fast much, pray oft, look lowly on the ground,</br>
                            And unto every one do courtesy meek:</br>
                            These looks (nought saying) do a benefice seek,</br>
                            But be thou sure one not to lack or long.</br>
                            And if thee list unto the court to throng,</br>
                            And there to hunt after the hoped prey,</br>
                            Then must thou thee dispose another way:</br>
                            For there thou needs must learn to laugh, to lie,</br>
                            To face, to forge, to scoff, to company,</br>
                            To crouch, to please, to be a beetle-stock</br>
                            Of thy great master's will, to scorn, or mock.</br>
                            So may'st thou chance mock out a benefice,</br>
                            Unless thou canst one conjure by device,</br>
                            Or cast a figure for a bishopric;</br>
                            And if one could, it were but a school trick.</br>
                            These be the ways by which without reward</br>
                            Livings in court be gotten, though full hard;</br>
                            For nothing there is done without a fee:</br>
                            The courtier needs must recompensed be</br>
                            With a benevolence, or have in gage</br>
                            The primitias of your parsonage:</br>
                            Scarce can a bishopric forpass them by,</br>
                            But that it must be gelt in privity.</br>
                            Do not thou therefore seek a living there,</br>
                            But of more private persons seek elsewhere,</br>
                            Whereas thou may'st compound a better penny,</br>
                            Ne let thy learning question'd be of any.</br>
                            For some good gentleman, that hath the right</br>
                            Unto his church for to present a wight,</br>
                            Will cope with thee in reasonable wise;</br>
                            That if the living yearly do arise</br>
                            To forty pound, that then his youngest son</br>
                            Shall twenty have, and twenty thou hast won:</br>
                            Thou hast it won, for it is of frank gift,</br>
                            And he will care for all the rest to shift,</br>
                            Both that the bishop may admit of thee,</br>
                            And that therein thou may'st maintained be.</br>
                            This is the way for one that is unlearn'd</br>
                            Living to get, and not to be discern'd.</br>
                            But they that are great clerks, have nearer ways,</br>
                            For learning sake to living them to raise;</br>
                            Yet many eke of them (God wot) are driven</br>
                            T' accept a benefice in pieces riven.</br>
                            How say'st thou (friend), have I not well discourst</br>
                            Upon this common-place (though plain, not worst)?</br>
                            Better a short tale than a bad long shriving.</br>
                            Needs any more to learn to get a living?\"</br>
                            </br>
                            \"Now sure, and by my halidom,\" (quoth he)</br>
                            \"Ye a great master are in your degree:</br>
                            Great thanks I yield you for your discipline,</br>
                            And do not doubt but duly to incline</br>
                            My wits thereto, as ye shall shortly hear.\"</br>
                            The priest him wish'd good speed, and well to fare:</br>
                            So parted they, as either's way them led.</br>
                            But th' ape and fox ere long so well them sped,</br>
                            Through the priest's wholesome counsel lately taught,</br>
                            And through their own fair handling wisely wrought,</br>
                            That they a benefice 'twixt them obtained;</br>
                            And crafty Reynold was a priest ordained,</br>
                            And th' ape his parish clerk procur'd to be.</br>
                            Then made they revel rout and goodly glee;</br>
                            But, ere long time had passed, they so ill</br>
                            Did order their affairs, that th' evil will</br>
                            Of all their parish'ners they had constrain'd;</br>
                            Who to the Ordinary of them complain'd,</br>
                            How foully they their offices abus'd,</br>
                            And them of crimes and heresies accus'd,</br>
                            That pursuivants he often for them sent;</br>
                            But they neglected his commandement.</br>
                            So long persisted obstinate and bold,</br>
                            Till at the length he published to hold</br>
                            A visitation, and them cited thether:</br>
                            Then was high time their wits about to geather.</br>
                            What did they then, but made a composition</br>
                            With their next neighbour priest, for light condition,</br>
                            To whom their living they resigned quite</br>
                            For a few pence, and ran away by night.</br>
