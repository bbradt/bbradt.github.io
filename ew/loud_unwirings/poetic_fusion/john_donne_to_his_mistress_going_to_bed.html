                        <h2>To His Mistress Going to Bed</h2>
                        <h3>By: JOHN DONNE</h3>
                        <p ">
Come, Madam, come, all rest my powers defy,</br>
Until I labour, I in labour lie.</br>
The foe oft-times having the foe in sight,</br>
Is tird with standing though he never fight.</br>
Off with that girdle, like heavens Zone glistering,</br>
But a far fairer world encompassing.</br>
Unpin that spangled breastplate which you wear,</br>
That theyes of busy fools may be stopped there.</br>
Unlace yourself, for that harmonious chime,</br>
Tells me from you, that now it is bed time.</br>
Off with that happy busk, which I envy,</br>
That still can be, and still can stand so nigh.</br>
Your gown going off, such beauteous state reveals,</br>
As when from flowery meads thhills shadow steals.</br>
Off with that wiry Coronet and shew</br>
The hairy Diadem which on you doth grow:</br>
Now off with those shoes, and then safely tread</br>
In this loves hallowd temple, this soft bed.</br>
In such white robes, heavens Angels used to be</br>
Received by men; Thou Angel bringst with thee</br>
A heaven like Mahomets Paradise; and though</br>
Ill spirits walk in white, we easily know,</br>
By this these Angels from an evil sprite,</br>
Those set our hairs, but these our flesh upright.</br>
    Licence my roving hands, and let them go,</br>
Before, behind, between, above, below.</br>
O my America! my new-found-land,</br>
My kingdom, safeliest when with one man mannd,</br>
My Mine of precious stones, My Empirie,</br>
How blest am I in this discovering thee!</br>
To enter in these bonds, is to be free;</br>
Then where my hand is set, my seal shall be.</br>
    Full nakedness! All joys are due to thee,</br>
As souls unbodied, bodies unclothd must be,</br>
To taste whole joys. Gems which you women use</br>
Are like Atlantas balls, cast in mens views,</br>
That when a fools eye lighteth on a Gem,</br>
His earthly soul may covet theirs, not them.</br>
Like pictures, or like books gay coverings made</br>
For lay-men, are all women thus arrayd;</br>
Themselves are mystic books, which only we</br>
(Whom their imputed grace will dignify)</br>
Must see reveald. Then since that I may know;</br>
As liberally, as to a Midwife, shew</br>
Thy self: cast all, yea, this white linen hence,</br>
There is no penance due to innocence.</br>
    To teach thee, I am naked first; why then</br>
What needst thou have more covering than a man.</br>
