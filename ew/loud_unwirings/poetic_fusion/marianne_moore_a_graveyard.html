                        <p ">
Man, looking into the sea</br>
taking the view from those who have as much right to it as you have it to yourself</br>
it is human nature to stand in the middle of a thing</br>
but you cannot stand in the middle of this:</br>
the sea has nothing to give but a well excavated grave.</br>
The firs stand in a processioneach with an emerald turkey-foot at the top</br>
reserved as their contours, saying nothing;</br>
repression, however, is not the most obvious characteristic of the sea;</br>
the sea is a collector, quick to return a rapacious look.</br>
There are others besides you who have worn that look</br>
whose expression is no longer a protest; the fish no longer investigate them</br>
for their bones have not lasted;</br>
men lower nets, unconscious of the fact that they are desecrating a grave,</br>
and row quickly awaythe blades of the oars   </br>
moving together like the feet of water-spiders as if there were no such thing as death.</br>
The wrinkles progress upon themselves in a phalanxbeautiful under networks of foam,</br>
and fade breathlessly while the sea rustles in and out of the seaweed;</br>
the birds swim through the air at top speed, emitting cat-calls as heretofore</br>
the tortoise-shell scourges about the feet of the cliffs, in motion beneath them</br>
and the ocean, under the pulsation of light-houses and noise of bell-buoys,</br>
advances as usual, looking as if it were not that ocean in which dropped things are bound to sink</br>
in which if they turn and twist, it is neither with volition nor consciousness.</br>
