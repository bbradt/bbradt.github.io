                        <h2>An Hymn In Honour Of Beauty</h2>
                        <h3>By: EDMUND SPENSER</h3>
                        <p ">
AH whither, Love, wilt thou now carry me?</br>
What wontless fury dost thou now inspire</br>
Into my feeble breast, too full of thee?</br>
Whilst seeking to aslake thy raging fire,</br>
Thou in me kindlest much more great desire,</br>
And up aloft above my strength dost raise</br>
The wondrous matter of my fire to praise.</br>
</br>
That as I erst in praise of thine own name,</br>
So now in honour of thy mother dear,</br>
An honourable hymn I eke should frame,</br>
And with the brightness of her beauty clear,</br>
The ravish'd hearts of gazeful men might rear</br>
To admiration of that heavenly light,</br>
From whence proceeds such soul-enchanting might.</br>
</br>
Thereto do thou, great goddess, queen of beauty,</br>
Mother of love, and of all world's delight,</br>
Without whose sovereign grace and kindly duty</br>
Nothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sight,</br>
Do thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light</br>
T' illuminate my dim and dulled eyne,</br>
And beautify this sacred hymn of thine:</br>
</br>
That both to thee, to whom I mean it most,</br>
And eke to her, whose fair immortal beam</br>
Hath darted fire into my feeble ghost,</br>
That now it wasted is with woes extreme,</br>
It may so please, that she at length will stream</br>
Some dew of grace into my withered heart,</br>
After long sorrow and consuming smart.</br>
</br>
WHAT time this world's great Workmaster did cast</br>
To make all things such as we now behold,</br>
It seems that he before his eyes had plac'd</br>
A goodly pattern, to whose perfect mould</br>
He fashion'd them as comely as he could;</br>
That now so fair and seemly they appear,</br>
As nought may be amended anywhere.</br>
</br>
That wondrous pattern, wheresoe'er it be,</br>
Whether in earth laid up in secret store,</br>
Or else in heaven, that no man may it see</br>
With sinful eyes, for fear it to deflore,</br>
Is perfect Beauty, which all men adore;</br>
Whose face and feature doth so much excel</br>
All mortal sense, that none the same may tell.</br>
</br>
Thereof as every earthly thing partakes</br>
Or more or less, by influence divine,</br>
So it more fair accordingly it makes,</br>
And the gross matter of this earthly mine,</br>
Which clotheth it, thereafter doth refine,</br>
Doing away the dross which dims the light</br>
Of that fair beam which therein is empight.</br>
</br>
For, through infusion of celestial power,</br>
The duller earth it quick'neth with delight,</br>
And lifeful spirits privily doth pour</br>
Through all the parts, that to the looker's sight</br>
They seem to please. That is thy sovereign might,</br>
O Cyprian queen, which flowing from the beam</br>
Of thy bright star, thou into them dost stream.</br>
</br>
That is the thing which giveth pleasant grace</br>
To all things fair, that kindleth lively fire,</br>
Light of thy lamp, which, shining in the face,</br>
Thence to the soul darts amorous desire,</br>
And robs the hearts of those which it admire;</br>
Therewith thou pointest thy son's poison'd arrow,</br>
That wounds the life, and wastes the inmost marrow.</br>
</br>
How vainly then do idle wits invent,</br>
That beauty is nought else but mixture made</br>
Of colours fair, and goodly temp'rament</br>
Of pure complexions, that shall quickly fade</br>
And pass away, like to a summer's shade;</br>
Or that it is but comely composition</br>
Of parts well measur'd, with meet disposition.</br>
</br>
Hath white and red in it such wondrous power,</br>
That it can pierce through th' eyes unto the heart,</br>
And therein stir such rage and restless stour,</br>
As nought but death can stint his dolour's smart?</br>
Or can proportion of the outward part</br>
Move such affection in the inward mind,</br>
That it can rob both sense and reason blind?</br>
</br>
Why do not then the blossoms of the field,</br>
Which are array'd with much more orient hue,</br>
And to the sense most dainty odours yield,</br>
Work like impression in the looker's view?</br>
Or why do not fair pictures like power shew,</br>
In which oft-times we nature see of art</br>
Excell'd, in perfect limning every part?</br>
</br>
But ah, believe me, there is more than so,</br>
That works such wonders in the minds of men;</br>
I, that have often prov'd, too well it know,</br>
And whoso list the like assays to ken,</br>
Shall find by trial, and confess it then,</br>
That beauty is not, as fond men misdeem,</br>
An outward shew of things, that only seem.</br>
</br>
For that same goodly hue of white and red,</br>
With which the cheeks are sprinkled, shall decay,</br>
And those sweet rosy leaves, so fairly spread</br>
Upon the lips, shall fade and fall away</br>
To that they were, even to corrupted clay;</br>
That golden wire, those sparkling stars so bright,</br>
Shall turn to dust; and lose their goodly light.</br>
</br>
But that fair lamp, from whose celestial ray</br>
That light proceeds, which kindleth lovers' fire,</br>
Shall never be extinguish'd nor decay;</br>
But when the vital spirits do expire,</br>
Unto her native planet shall retire;</br>
For it is heavenly born and cannot die,</br>
Being a parcel of the purest sky.</br>
</br>
For when the soul, the which derived was,</br>
At first, out of that great immortal Spright,</br>
By whom all live to love, whilom did pass</br>
Down from the top of purest heaven's height</br>
To be embodied here, it then took light</br>
And lively spirits from that fairest star,</br>
Which lights the world forth from his fiery car.</br>
</br>
Which power retaining still or more or less,</br>
When she in fleshly seed is eft enraced,</br>
Through every part she doth the same impress,</br>
According as the heavens have her graced,</br>
And frames her house, in which she will be placed,</br>
Fit for herself, adorning it with spoil</br>
Of th' heavenly riches which she robb'd erewhile.</br>
</br>
Thereof it comes that these fair souls, which have</br>
The most resemblance of that heavenly light,</br>
Frame to themselves most beautiful and brave</br>
Their fleshly bower, most fit for their delight,</br>
And the gross matter by a sovereign might</br>
Tempers so trim, that it may well be seen</br>
A palace fit for such a virgin queen.</br>
</br>
So every spirit, as it is most pure,</br>
And hath in it the more of heavenly light,</br>
So it the fairer body doth procure</br>
To habit in, and it more fairly dight</br>
With cheerful grace and amiable sight.</br>
For of the soul the body form doth take:</br>
For soul is form, and doth the body make.</br>
</br>
Therefore wherever that thou dost behold</br>
A comely corpse, with beauty fair endued,</br>
Know this for certain, that the same doth hold</br>
A beauteous soul, with fair conditions thewed,</br>
Fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed.</br>
For all that fair is, is by nature good;</br>
That is a sign to know the gentle blood.</br>
</br>
Yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind</br>
Dwells in deformed tabernacle drown'd,</br>
Either by chance, against the course of kind,</br>
Or through unaptness in the substance found,</br>
Which it assumed of some stubborn ground,</br>
That will not yield unto her form's direction,</br>
But is deform'd with some foul imperfection.</br>
</br>
And oft it falls, (ay me, the more to rue)</br>
That goodly beauty, albe heavenly born,</br>
Is foul abus'd, and that celestial hue,</br>
Which doth the world with her delight adorn,</br>
Made but the bait of sin, and sinners' scorn,</br>
Whilst every one doth seek and sue to have it,</br>
But every one doth seek but to deprave it.</br>
</br>
Yet nathemore is that fair beauty's blame,</br>
But theirs that do abuse it unto ill:</br>
Nothing so good, but that through guilty shame</br>
May be corrupt, and wrested unto will:</br>
Natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still,</br>
However flesh{\"e}s fault it filthy make;</br>
                            For things immortal no corruption take.</br>
                            </br>
                            But ye fair dames, the world's dear ornaments</br>
                            And lively images of heaven's light,</br>
                            Let not your beams with such disparagements</br>
                            Be dimm'd, and your bright glory dark'ned quite;</br>
                            But mindful still of your first country's sight,</br>
                            Do still preserve your first informed grace,</br>
                            Whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face.</br>
                            </br>
                            Loathe that foul blot, that hellish firebrand,</br>
                            Disloyal lust, fair beauty's foulest blame,</br>
                            That base affections, which your ears would bland,</br>
                            Commend to you by love's abused name,</br>
                            But is indeed the bondslave of defame;</br>
                            Which will the garland of your glory mar,</br>
                            And quench the light of your bright shining star.</br>
                            </br>
                            But gentle Love, that loyal is and true,</br>
                            Will more illumine your resplendent ray,</br>
                            And add more brightness to your goodly hue,</br>
                            From light of his pure fire; which, by like way</br>
                            Kindled of yours, your likeness doth display;</br>
                            Like as two mirrors, by oppos'd reflection,</br>
                            Do both express the face's first impression.</br>
                            </br>
                            Therefore, to make your beauty more appear,</br>
                            It you behoves to love, and forth to lay</br>
                            That heavenly riches which in you ye bear,</br>
                            That men the more admire their fountain may;</br>
                            For else what booteth that celestial ray,</br>
                            If it in darkness be enshrined ever,</br>
                            That it of loving eyes be viewed never?</br>
                            </br>
                            But, in your choice of loves, this well advise,</br>
                            That likest to yourselves ye them select,</br>
                            The which your forms' first source may sympathize,</br>
                            And with like beauty's parts be inly deckt;</br>
                            For, if you loosely love without respect,</br>
                            It is no love, but a discordant war,</br>
                            Whose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar.</br>
                            </br>
                            For love is a celestial harmony</br>
                            Of likely hearts compos'd of stars' concent,</br>
                            Which join together in sweet sympathy,</br>
                            To work each other's joy and true content,</br>
                            Which they have harbour'd since their first descent</br>
                            Out of their heavenly bowers, where they did see</br>
                            And know each other here belov'd to be.</br>
                            </br>
                            Then wrong it were that any other twain</br>
                            Should in love's gentle band combined be</br>
                            But those whom Heaven did at first ordain,</br>
                            And made out of one mould the more t' agree;</br>
                            For all that like the beauty which they see,</br>
                            Straight do not love; for love is not so light</br>
                            As straight to burn at first beholder's sight.</br>
                            </br>
                            But they, which love indeed, look otherwise,</br>
                            With pure regard and spotless true intent,</br>
                            Drawing out of the object of their eyes</br>
                            A more refined form, which they present</br>
                            Unto their mind, void of all blemishment;</br>
                            Which it reducing to her first perfection,</br>
                            Beholdeth free from flesh's frail infection.</br>
                            </br>
                            And then conforming it unto the light,</br>
                            Which in itself it hath remaining still,</br>
                            Of that first Sun, yet sparkling in his sight,</br>
                            Thereof he fashions in his higher skill</br>
                            An heavenly beauty to his fancy's will;</br>
                            And it embracing in his mind entire,</br>
                            The mirror of his own thought doth admire.</br>
                            </br>
                            Which seeing now so inly fair to be,</br>
                            As outward it appeareth to the eye,</br>
                            And with his spirit's proportion to agree,</br>
                            He thereon fixeth all his fantasy,</br>
                            And fully setteth his felicity;</br>
                            Counting it fairer than it is indeed,</br>
                            And yet indeed her fairness doth exceed.</br>
                            </br>
                            For lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be</br>
                            Than other men's, and in dear love's delight</br>
                            See more than any other eyes can see,</br>
                            Through mutual receipt of beam{\"e}s bright,</br>
                            Which carry privy message to the spright,</br>
                            And to their eyes that inmost fair display,</br>
                            As plain as light discovers dawning day.</br>
                            </br>
                            Therein they see, through amorous eye-glances,</br>
                            Armies of loves still flying to and fro,</br>
                            Which dart at them their little fiery lances;</br>
                            Whom having wounded, back again they go,</br>
                            Carrying compassion to their lovely foe;</br>
                            Who, seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect,</br>
                            Cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect.</br>
                            </br>
                            In which how many wonders do they rede</br>
                            To their conceit, that others never see,</br>
                            Now of her smiles, with which their souls they feed,</br>
                            Like gods with nectar in their banquets free;</br>
                            Now of her looks, which like to cordials be;</br>
                            But when her words' embassade forth she sends,</br>
                            Lord, how sweet music that unto them lends.</br>
                            </br>
                            Sometimes upon her forehead they behold</br>
                            A thousand graces masking in delight;</br>
                            Sometimes within her eyelids they unfold</br>
                            Ten thousand sweet belgards, which to their sight</br>
                            Do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night;</br>
                            But on her lips, like rosy buds in May,</br>
                            So many millions of chaste pleasures play.</br>
                            </br>
                            All those, O Cytherea, and thousands more</br>
                            Thy handmaids be, which do on thee attend,</br>
                            To deck thy beauty with their dainties' store,</br>
                            That may it more to mortal eyes commend,</br>
                            And make it more admir'd of foe and friend:</br>
                            That in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install,</br>
                            And spread thy lovely kingdom over all.</br>
                            </br>
                            Then Io, triumph! O great Beauty's Queen,</br>
                            Advance the banner of thy conquest high,</br>
                            That all this world, the which thy vassals bene,</br>
                            May draw to thee, and with due fealty</br>
                            Adore the power of thy great majesty,</br>
                            Singing this hymn in honour of thy name,</br>
                            Compil'd by me, which thy poor liegeman am.</br>
                            </br>
                            In lieu whereof grant, O great sovereign,</br>
                            That she whose conquering beauty doth captive</br>
                            My trembling heart in her eternal chain,</br>
                            One drop of grace at length will to me give,</br>
                            That I her bounden thrall by her may live,</br>
                            And this same life, which first fro me she reaved,</br>
                            May owe to her, of whom I it received.</br>
                            </br>
                            And you, fair Venus' darling, my dear dread,</br>
                            Fresh flower of grace, great goddess of my life,</br>
                            When your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read,</br>
                            Deign to let fall one drop of due relief,</br>
                            That may recure my heart's long pining grief,</br>
                            And shew what wondrous power your beauty hath,</br>
                            That can restore a damned wight from death.</br>
