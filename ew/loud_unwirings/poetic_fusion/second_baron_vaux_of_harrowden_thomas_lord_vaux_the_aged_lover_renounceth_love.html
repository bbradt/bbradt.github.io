                        <p ">
I loathe that I did love,</br>
In youth that I thought sweet,</br>
As time requires for my behove,</br>
Methinks they are not meet.</br>
</br>
My lusts they do me leave,</br>
My fancies all be fled,</br>
And tract of time begins to weave</br>
Grey hairs upon my head,</br>
</br>
For age with stealing steps</br>
Hath clawed me with his crutch,</br>
And lusty life away she leaps</br>
As there had been none such.</br>
</br>
My Muse doth not delight</br>
Me as she did before;</br>
My hand and pen are not in plight,</br>
As they have been of yore.</br>
</br>
For reason me denies</br>
This youthly idle rhyme;</br>
And day by day to me she cries,</br>
Leave off these toys in time.</br>
</br>
The wrinkles in my brow,</br>
The furrows in my face,</br>
Say, limping age will lodge him now</br>
Where youth must give him place.</br>
</br>
The harbinger of death,</br>
To me I see him ride,</br>
The cough, the cold, the gasping breath</br>
Doth bid me provide</br>
</br>
A pickaxe and a spade,</br>
And eke a shrouding sheet,</br>
A house of clay for to be made</br>
For such a guest most meet.</br>
</br>
Methinks I hear the clark</br>
That knolls the careful knell,</br>
And bids me leave my woeful wark,</br>
Ere nature me compel.</br>
</br>
My keepers knit the knot</br>
That youth did laugh to scorn,</br>
Of me that clean shall be forgot</br>
As I had not been born.</br>
</br>
Thus must I youth give up,</br>
Whose badge I long did wear;</br>
To them I yield the wanton cup</br>
That better may it bear.</br>
</br>
Lo, here the bared skull,</br>
By whose bald sign I know</br>
That stooping age away shall pull</br>
Which youthful years did sow.</br>
</br>
For beauty with her band</br>
These crooked cares hath wrought,</br>
And shipped me into the land</br>
From whence I first was brought.</br>
</br>
And ye that bide behind,</br>
Have ye none other trust:</br>
As ye of clay were cast by kind,</br>
So shall ye waste to dust.</br>
