                        <p ">
Were you but lying cold and dead,</br>
And lights were paling out of the West,</br>
You would come hither, and bend your head,</br>
And I would lay my head on your breast;</br>
And you would murmur tender words,</br>
Forgiving me, because you were dead:</br>
Nor would you rise and hasten away,</br>
Though you have the will of wild birds,</br>
But know your hair was bound and wound</br>
About the stars and moon and sun:</br>
O would, beloved, that you lay</br>
Under the dock-leaves in the ground,</br>
While lights were paling one by one.</br>
