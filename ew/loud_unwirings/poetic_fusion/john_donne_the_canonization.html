                        <h2>The Canonization</h2>
                        <h3>By: JOHN DONNE</h3>
                        <p ">
For God's sake hold your tongue, and let me love,</br>
         Or chide my palsy, or my gout,</br>
My five gray hairs, or ruined fortune flout,</br>
         With wealth your state, your mind with arts improve,</br>
                Take you a course, get you a place,</br>
                Observe his honor, or his grace,</br>
Or the king's real, or his stamped face</br>
         Contemplate; what you will, approve,</br>
         So you will let me love.</br>
</br>
Alas, alas, who's injured by my love?</br>
         What merchant's ships have my sighs drowned?</br>
Who says my tears have overflowed his ground?</br>
         When did my colds a forward spring remove?</br>
                When did the heats which my veins fill</br>
                Add one more to the plaguy bill?</br>
Soldiers find wars, and lawyers find out still</br>
         Litigious men, which quarrels move,</br>
         Though she and I do love.</br>
</br>
Call us what you will, we are made such by love;</br>
         Call her one, me another fly,</br>
We're tapers too, and at our own cost die,</br>
         And we in us find the eagle and the dove.</br>
                The phnix riddle hath more wit</br>
                By us; we two being one, are it.</br>
So, to one neutral thing both sexes fit.</br>
         We die and rise the same, and prove</br>
         Mysterious by this love.</br>
</br>
We can die by it, if not live by love,</br>
         And if unfit for tombs and hearse</br>
Our legend be, it will be fit for verse;</br>
         And if no piece of chronicle we prove,</br>
                We'll build in sonnets pretty rooms;</br>
                As well a well-wrought urn becomes</br>
The greatest ashes, as half-acre tombs,</br>
         And by these hymns, all shall approve</br>
         Us canonized for Love.</br>
</br>
And thus invoke us: \"You, whom reverend love</br>
                            Made one another's hermitage;</br>
                            You, to whom love was peace, that now is rage;</br>
                            Who did the whole world's soul contract, and drove</br>
                            Into the glasses of your eyes</br>
                            (So made such mirrors, and such spies,</br>
                            That they did all to you epitomize)</br>
                            Countries, towns, courts: beg from above</br>
                            A pattern of your love!\"</br>
                        </p>
