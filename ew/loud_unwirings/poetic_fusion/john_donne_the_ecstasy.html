                        <h2>The Ecstasy</h2>
                        <h3>By: JOHN DONNE</h3>
                        <p ">
Where, like a pillow on a bed</br>
         A pregnant bank swell'd up to rest</br>
The violet's reclining head,</br>
         Sat we two, one another's best.</br>
Our hands were firmly cemented</br>
         With a fast balm, which thence did spring;</br>
Our eye-beams twisted, and did thread</br>
         Our eyes upon one double string;</br>
So to'intergraft our hands, as yet</br>
         Was all the means to make us one,</br>
And pictures in our eyes to get</br>
         Was all our propagation.</br>
As 'twixt two equal armies fate</br>
         Suspends uncertain victory,</br>
Our souls (which to advance their state</br>
         Were gone out) hung 'twixt her and me.</br>
And whilst our souls negotiate there,</br>
         We like sepulchral statues lay;</br>
All day, the same our postures were,</br>
         And we said nothing, all the day.</br>
If any, so by love refin'd</br>
         That he soul's language understood,</br>
And by good love were grown all mind,</br>
         Within convenient distance stood,</br>
He (though he knew not which soul spake,</br>
         Because both meant, both spake the same)</br>
Might thence a new concoction take</br>
         And part far purer than he came.</br>
This ecstasy doth unperplex,</br>
         We said, and tell us what we love;</br>
We see by this it was not sex,</br>
         We see we saw not what did move;</br>
But as all several souls contain</br>
         Mixture of things, they know not what,</br>
Love these mix'd souls doth mix again</br>
         And makes both one, each this and that.</br>
A single violet transplant,</br>
         The strength, the colour, and the size,</br>
(All which before was poor and scant)</br>
         Redoubles still, and multiplies.</br>
When love with one another so</br>
         Interinanimates two souls,</br>
That abler soul, which thence doth flow,</br>
         Defects of loneliness controls.</br>
We then, who are this new soul, know</br>
         Of what we are compos'd and made,</br>
For th' atomies of which we grow</br>
         Are souls, whom no change can invade.</br>
But oh alas, so long, so far,</br>
         Our bodies why do we forbear?</br>
They'are ours, though they'are not we; we are</br>
         The intelligences, they the spheres.</br>
We owe them thanks, because they thus</br>
         Did us, to us, at first convey,</br>
Yielded their senses' force to us,</br>
         Nor are dross to us, but allay.</br>
On man heaven's influence works not so,</br>
         But that it first imprints the air;</br>
So soul into the soul may flow,</br>
            Though it to body first repair.</br>
As our blood labors to beget</br>
         Spirits, as like souls as it can,</br>
Because such fingers need to knit</br>
         That subtle knot which makes us man,</br>
So must pure lovers' souls descend</br>
         T' affections, and to faculties,</br>
Which sense may reach and apprehend,</br>
         Else a great prince in prison lies.</br>
To'our bodies turn we then, that so</br>
         Weak men on love reveal'd may look;</br>
Love's mysteries in souls do grow,</br>
         But yet the body is his book.</br>
And if some lover, such as we,</br>
         Have heard this dialogue of one,</br>
Let him still mark us, he shall see</br>
         Small change, when we'are to bodies gone.</br>
