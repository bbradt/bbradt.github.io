                        <h2>Tortoise Gallantry</h2>
                        <h3>By: D. H. LAWRENCE</h3>
                        <p ">
Making his advances</br>
He does not look at her, nor sniff at her,</br>
No, not even sniff at her, his nose is blank.</br>
</br>
Only he senses the vulnerable folds of skin</br>
That work beneath her while she sprawls along</br>
In her ungainly pace,</br>
Her folds of skin that work and row</br>
Beneath the earth-soiled hovel in which she moves.</br>
</br>
And so he strains beneath her housey walls</br>
And catches her trouser-legs in his beak</br>
Suddenly, or her skinny limb,</br>
And strange and grimly drags at her</br>
Like a dog,</br>
Only agelessly silent, with a reptile's awful persistency.</br>
</br>
Grim, gruesome gallantry, to which he is doomed.</br>
Dragged out of an eternity of silent isolation</br>
And doomed to partiality, partial being,</br>
Ache, and want of being,</br>
Want,</br>
Self-exposure, hard humiliation, need to add himself on to her.</br>
</br>
Born to walk alone,</br>
Forerunner,</br>
Now suddenly distracted into this mazy side-track,</br>
This awkward, harrowing pursuit,</br>
This grim necessity from within.</br>
</br>
Does she know</br>
As she moves eternally slowly away?</br>
Or is he driven against her with a bang, like a bird flying in the dark against a window,</br>
All knowledgeless?</br>
</br>
The awful concussion,</br>
And the still more awful need to persist, to follow, follow, continue,</br>
Driven, after ons of pristine, fore-god-like singleness and oneness,</br>
At the end of some mysterious, red-hot iron,</br>
Driven away from himself into her tracks,</br>
Forced to crash against her.</br>
</br>
Stiff, gallant, irascible, crook-legged reptile,</br>
Little gentleman,</br>
Sorry plight,</br>
We ought to look the other way.</br>
</br>
Save that, having come with you so far,</br>
We will go on to the end.</br>
