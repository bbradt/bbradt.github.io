                        <h2>Portrait of a Lady</h2>
                        <h3>By: T. S. ELIOT</h3>
                        <p ">
I</br>
Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon</br>
You have the scene arrange itself  as it will seem to do</br>
With \"I have saved this afternoon for you\ ";</br>
And four wax candles in the darkened room,</br>
Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,</br>
An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb</br>
Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.</br>
We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole</br>
Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.</br>
\"So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul</br>
                            Should be resurrected only among friends</br>
                            Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom</br>
                            That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room.\"</br>
                            And so the conversation slips</br>
                            Among velleities and carefully caught regrets</br>
                            Through attenuated tones of violins</br>
                            Mingled with remote cornets</br>
                            And begins.</br>
                            </br>
                            \"You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends,</br>
                            And how, how rare and strange it is, to find</br>
                            In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends,</br>
                            (For indeed I do not love it ... you knew? you are not blind!</br>
                            How keen you are!)</br>
                            To find a friend who has these qualities,</br>
                            Who has, and gives</br>
                            Those qualities upon which friendship lives.</br>
                            How much it means that I say this to you </br>
                            Without these friendships life, what cauchemar!\"</br>
                            Among the winding of the violins</br>
                            And the ariettes</br>
                            Of cracked cornets</br>
                            Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins</br>
                            Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own,</br>
                            Capricious monotone</br>
                            That is at least one definite \"false note.\"</br>
                            Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance,</br>
                            Admire the monuments,</br>
                            Discuss the late events,</br>
                            Correct our watches by the public clocks.</br>
                            Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks.</br>
                            </br>
                            II</br>
                            Now that lilacs are in bloom</br>
                            She has a bowl of lilacs in her room</br>
                            And twists one in her fingers while she talks.</br>
                            \"Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know</br>
                            What life is, you who hold it in your hands\";</br>
                            (Slowly twisting the lilac stalks)</br>
                            \"You let it flow from you, you let it flow,</br>
                            And youth is cruel, and has no remorse</br>
                            And smiles at situations which it cannot see.\"</br>
                            I smile, of course,</br>
                            And go on drinking tea.</br>
                            \"Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall</br>
                            My buried life, and Paris in the Spring,</br>
                            I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world</br>
                            To be wonderful and youthful, after all.\"</br>
                            </br>
                            The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune</br>
                            Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:</br>
                            \"I am always sure that you understand</br>
                            My feelings, always sure that you feel,</br>
                            Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand.</br>
                            </br>
                            You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles' heel.</br>
                            You will go on, and when you have prevailed</br>
                            You can say: at this point many a one has failed.</br>
                            </br>
                            But what have I, but what have I, my friend,</br>
                            To give you, what can you receive from me?</br>
                            Only the friendship and the sympathy</br>
                            Of one about to reach her journey's end.</br>
                            </br>
                            I shall sit here, serving tea to friends ....\"</br>
                            </br>
                            I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends</br>
                            For what she has said to me?</br>
                            You will see me any morning in the park</br>
                            Reading the comics and the sporting page.</br>
                            Particularly I remark.</br>
                            An English countess goes upon the stage.</br>
                            A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance,</br>
                            Another bank defaulter has confessed.</br>
                            I keep my countenance,</br>
                            I remain self-possessed</br>
                            Except when a street-piano, mechanical and tired</br>
                            Reiterates some worn-out common song</br>
                            With the smell of hyacinths across the garden</br>
                            Recalling things that other people have desired.</br>
                            Are these ideas right or wrong?</br>
                            </br>
                            III</br>
                            The October night comes down; returning as before</br>
                            Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease</br>
                            I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door</br>
                            And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.</br>
                            \"And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?</br>
                            But that's a useless question.</br>
                            You hardly know when you are coming back,</br>
                            You will find so much to learn.\"</br>
                            My smile falls heavily among the bric-a-brac.</br>
                            </br>
                            \"Perhaps you can write to me.\"</br>
                            My self-possession flares up for a second;</br>
                            This is as I had reckoned.</br>
                            \"I have been wondering frequently of late</br>
                            (But our beginnings never know our ends!)</br>
                            Why we have not developed into friends.\"</br>
                            I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark</br>
                            Suddenly, his expression in a glass.</br>
                            My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark.</br>
                            </br>
                            \"For everybody said so, all our friends,</br>
                            They all were sure our feelings would relate</br>
                            So closely! I myself can hardly understand.</br>
                            We must leave it now to fate.</br>
                            You will write, at any rate.</br>
                            Perhaps it is not too late.</br>
                            I shall sit here, serving tea to friends.\"</br>
                            And I must borrow every changing shape</br>
                            To find expression ... dance, dance</br>
                            Like a dancing bear,</br>
                            Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape.</br>
                            Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance</br>
                            Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,</br>
                            Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;</br>
                            Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand</br>
                            With the smoke coming down above the housetops;</br>
                            Doubtful, for quite a while</br>
                            Not knowing what to feel or if I understand</br>
                            Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon ...</br>
                            Would she not have the advantage, after all?</br>
                            This music is successful with a \"dying fall\"</br>
                            Now that we talk of dying</br>
                            And should I have the right to smile?</br>
                        </p>
