                        <p ">
I</br>
</br>
Calm was the sea to which your course you kept,</br>
Oh, how much calmer than all southern seas!</br>
Many your nameless mates, whom the keen breeze</br>
Wafted from mothers that of old have wept.</br>
All souls of children taken as they slept</br>
Are your companions, partners of your ease,</br>
And the green souls of all these autumn trees</br>
Are with you through the silent spaces swept.</br>
Your virgin body gave its gentle breath</br>
Untainted to the gods. Why should we grieve,</br>
But that we merit not your holy death?</br>
We shall not loiter long, your friends and I;</br>
Living you made it goodlier to live,</br>
Dead you will make it easier to die.</br>
</br>
II</br>
</br>
With you a part of me hath passed away;</br>
For in the peopled forest of my mind</br>
A tree made leafless by this wintry wind</br>
Shall never don again its green array.</br>
Chapel and fireside, country road and bay,</br>
Have something of their friendliness resigned;</br>
Another, if I would, I could not find,</br>
And I am grown much older in a day.</br>
But yet I treasure in my memory</br>
Your gift of charity, your mellow ease,</br>
And the dear honour of your amity;</br>
For these once mine, my life is rich with these.</br>
And I scarce know which part may greater be,</br>
What I keep of you, or you rob of me.</br>
</br>
III</br>
</br>
Your bark lies anchored in the peaceful bight</br>
Until a kinder wind unfurl her sail;</br>
Your docile spirit, winged by this gale,</br>
Hath at the dawning fled into the light.</br>
And I half know why heaven deemed it right</br>
Your youth, and this my joy in youth, should fail;</br>
God hath them still, for ever they avail,</br>
Eternity hath borrowed that delight.</br>
For long ago I taught my thoughts to run</br>
Where all the great things live that lived of yore,</br>
And in eternal quiet float and soar;</br>
There all my loves are gathered into one,</br>
Where change is not, nor parting any more,</br>
Nor revolution of the moon and sun.</br>
</br>
IV</br>
</br>
In my deep heart these chimes would still have rung</br>
To toll your passing, had you not been dead;</br>
For time a sadder mask than death may spread</br>
Over the face that ever should be young.</br>
The bough that falls with all its trophies hung</br>
Falls not too soon, but lays its flower-crowned head</br>
Most royal in the dust, with no leaf shed</br>
Unhallowed or unchiselled or unsung.</br>
And though the after world will never hear</br>
The happy name of one so gently true,</br>
Nor chronicles write large this fatal year,</br>
Yet we who loved you, though we be but few,</br>
Keep you in whatsoeer is good, and rear</br>
In our weak virtues monuments to you.</br>
