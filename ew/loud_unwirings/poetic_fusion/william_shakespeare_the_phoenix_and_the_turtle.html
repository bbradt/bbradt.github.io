                        <h2>The Phoenix and the Turtle</h2>
                        <h3>By: WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</h3>
                        <p ">
Let the bird of loudest lay</br>
On the sole Arabian tree</br>
Herald sad and trumpet be,</br>
To whose sound chaste wings obey.</br>
</br>
But thou shrieking harbinger,</br>
Foul precurrer of the fiend,</br>
Augur of the fever's end,</br>
To this troop come thou not near.</br>
</br>
From this session interdict</br>
Every fowl of tyrant wing,</br>
Save the eagle, feather'd king;</br>
Keep the obsequy so strict.</br>
</br>
Let the priest in surplice white,</br>
That defunctive music can,</br>
Be the death-divining swan,</br>
Lest the requiem lack his right.</br>
</br>
And thou treble-dated crow,</br>
That thy sable gender mak'st</br>
With the breath thou giv'st and tak'st,</br>
'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.</br>
</br>
Here the anthem doth commence:</br>
Love and constancy is dead;</br>
Phoenix and the Turtle fled</br>
In a mutual flame from hence.</br>
</br>
So they lov'd, as love in twain</br>
Had the essence but in one;</br>
Two distincts, division none:</br>
Number there in love was slain.</br>
</br>
Hearts remote, yet not asunder;</br>
Distance and no space was seen</br>
'Twixt this Turtle and his queen:</br>
But in them it were a wonder.</br>
</br>
So between them love did shine</br>
That the Turtle saw his right</br>
Flaming in the Phoenix' sight:</br>
Either was the other's mine.</br>
</br>
Property was thus appalled</br>
That the self was not the same;</br>
Single nature's double name</br>
Neither two nor one was called.</br>
</br>
Reason, in itself confounded,</br>
Saw division grow together,</br>
To themselves yet either neither,</br>
Simple were so well compounded;</br>
</br>
That it cried, \"How true a twain</br>
                            Seemeth this concordant one!</br>
                            Love has reason, reason none,</br>
                            If what parts can so remain.\"</br>
                            </br>
                            Whereupon it made this threne</br>
                            To the Phoenix and the Dove,</br>
                            Co-supremes and stars of love,</br>
                            As chorus to their tragic scene:</br>
                            </br>
                            threnos</br>
                            </br>
                            Beauty, truth, and rarity,</br>
                            Grace in all simplicity,</br>
                            Here enclos'd, in cinders lie.</br>
                            </br>
                            Death is now the Phoenix' nest,</br>
                            And the Turtle's loyal breast</br>
                            To eternity doth rest,</br>
                            </br>
                            Leaving no posterity:</br>
                            'Twas not their infirmity,</br>
                            It was married chastity.</br>
                            </br>
                            Truth may seem but cannot be;</br>
                            Beauty brag but 'tis not she;</br>
                            Truth and beauty buried be.</br>
                            </br>
                            To this urn let those repair</br>
                            That are either true or fair;</br>
                            For these dead birds sigh a prayer.</br>
