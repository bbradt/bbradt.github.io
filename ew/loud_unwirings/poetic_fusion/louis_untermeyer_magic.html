                        <h3>By: LOUIS UNTERMEYER</h3>
                        <p ">
We passed old farmer Boothby in the field.</br>
Rugged and straight he stood; his body steeled</br>
With stubbornness and age. We met his eyes</br>
That never flinched or turned to compromise,</br>
And Luck, he cried, good luck!and waved an arm,</br>
Knotted and sailor-like, such as no farm</br>
In all of Maine could boast of; and away</br>
He turned again to pitch his new-cut hay...</br>
We walked on leisurely until a bend</br>
Showed him once more, now working toward the end</br>
Of one great path; wearing his eighty years</br>
Like banners lifted in a wind of cheers.</br>
</br>
Then we turned off abruptlytook the road</br>
Cutting the village, the one with the commanding</br>
View of the river. And we strode</br>
More briskly now to the long pier that showed</br>
Where the frail boats were kept at Indian Landing.</br>
In the canoe we stepped; our paddles dipped</br>
Leisurely downwards, and the slim bark slipped</br>
More on than in the water. Smoothly then</br>
We shot its nose against the rippling current,</br>
Feeling the rising rivers half-deterrent</br>
Pull on the paddle as we turned the blade</br>
To keep from swerving round; while we delayed</br>
To watch the curious wave-eaten locks;</br>
Or pass, with lazy turns, the picnic-rocks....</br>
Blue eels flew under us, and fishes darted</br>
A thousand ways; the once broad channel shrunk.</br>
And over us the wise and noble-hearted</br>
Twilight leaned down; the sunset mists were parted,</br>
And we, with thoughts on tiptoe, slunk</br>
Down the green, twisting alleys of the Kennebunk,</br>
</br>
Motionless in the meadows</br>
The trees, the rocks, the cows...</br>
And quiet dripped from the shadows</br>
Like rain from heavy boughs.</br>
</br>
The tree-toads started ringing</br>
Their ceaseless silver bells;</br>
A land-locked breeze came swinging</br>
Its censer of earthy smells.</br>
</br>
The rivers tiny canon</br>
Stretched into dusky lands;</br>
Like a dark and silent companion</br>
Evening held out her hands.</br>
</br>
Hushed were the dawns bravados;</br>
Loud noon was a silenced cry</br>
And quiet slipped from the shadows</br>
As stars slip out of the sky...</br>
</br>
It must have been an hour more, or later,</br>
When, tramping homeward through the piney wood,</br>
We felt the years fly back; the brotherhood</br>
Of forests took usand we saw the satyr!</br>
There in a pool, up to his neck, he stood</br>
And grinned to see us stare, incredulous</br>
Too startled to remember fear or flight.</br>
Feeling the menace in the crafty night,</br>
We turned to runwhen lo, he called to us!</br>
Using our very names he called. We drew</br>
With creaking courage down the avenue</br>
Of birches till we saw, with clearing sight,</br>
(No longer through a tricky, pale-green light)</br>
Familiar turns and shrubs, the friendly path,</br>
And Farmer Boothby in his woodland bath!</br>
The woods became his background; every tree</br>
Seemed part of him, and stood erect, and shared</br>
The beauty of that gnarled serenity;</br>
The quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared</br>
Its shoulders against Time ... And even night</br>
Flowed in and out of him, as though content</br>
With such a native element;</br>
Happy to move about a spirit quite</br>
As old, as placid and as confident...</br>
Sideways we turned. Still glistening and unclad</br>
He leaped up on the bank, light as a lad,</br>
His body in the moonlight dripping stars...</br>
</br>
We went on homeward, through the pasture-bars.</br>
