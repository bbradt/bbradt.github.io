<h2>In Memory of Bryan Lathrop</h2>
<h3>By: EDGAR LEE MASTERS</h3>
<p">
   So in Pieria, from the wedded bliss</br>
Of Time and Memory, the Muses came</br>
To be the means of rich oblivion,</br>
And rest from cares.  And when the Thunderer</br>
Took heaven, then the Titans warred on him</br>
For pity of mankind. But the great law,</br>
Which is the law of music, not of bread,</br>
Set Atlas for a pillar, manacled</br>
His brother to the rocks of the Scythia,</br>
And under Aetna fixed the furious Typhon.</br>
So should thought rule, not force. And Amphion,</br>
Pursuing justice, entered Thebes and slew</br>
His mother's spouse; but when he would make sure</br>
And fortify the city, then he took</br>
The lyre that Hermes gave, and played, and watched</br>
The stones move and assemble, till a wall</br>
Engirded Thebes and kept the citadel</br>
Beyond the reach of arrows and of fire.</br>
What other power but harmony can build</br>
A city, and what gift so magical</br>
As that by which a city lifts its walls?</br>
So men, in years to come, shall feel the power</br>
Of this man moving through the high-ranged thought</br>
Which plans for beauty, builds for larger life.</br>
The stones shall rise in towers to answer him.</br>
