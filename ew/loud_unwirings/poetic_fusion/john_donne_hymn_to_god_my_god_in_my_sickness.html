                        <h3>By: JOHN DONNE</h3>
                        <p ">
Since I am coming to that holy room,</br>
         Where, with thy choir of saints for evermore,</br>
I shall be made thy music; as I come</br>
         I tune the instrument here at the door,</br>
         And what I must do then, think here before.</br>
</br>
Whilst my physicians by their love are grown</br>
         Cosmographers, and I their map, who lie</br>
Flat on this bed, that by them may be shown</br>
         That this is my south-west discovery,</br>
      Per fretum febris, by these straits to die,</br>
</br>
I joy, that in these straits I see my west;</br>
         For, though their currents yield return to none,</br>
What shall my west hurt me? As west and east</br>
         In all flat maps (and I am one) are one,</br>
         So death doth touch the resurrection.</br>
</br>
Is the Pacific Sea my home? Or are</br>
         The eastern riches? Is Jerusalem?</br>
Anyan, and Magellan, and Gibraltar,</br>
         All straits, and none but straits, are ways to them,</br>
         Whether where Japhet dwelt, or Cham, or Shem.</br>
</br>
We think that Paradise and Calvary,</br>
         Christ's cross, and Adam's tree, stood in one place;</br>
Look, Lord, and find both Adams met in me;</br>
         As the first Adam's sweat surrounds my face,</br>
         May the last Adam's blood my soul embrace.</br>
</br>
So, in his purple wrapp'd, receive me, Lord;</br>
         By these his thorns, give me his other crown;</br>
And as to others' souls I preach'd thy word,</br>
         Be this my text, my sermon to mine own:</br>
\"Therefore that he may raise, the Lord throws down.\ "</br>
