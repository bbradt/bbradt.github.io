                        <h2>The Haunted Oak</h2>
                        <h3>By: PAUL LAURENCE DUNBAR</h3>
                        <p ">
Pray why are you so bare, so bare,</br>
   Oh, bough of the old oak-tree;</br>
And why, when I go through the shade you throw,</br>
   Runs a shudder over me?</br>
</br>
My leaves were green as the best, I trow,</br>
   And sap ran free in my veins,</br>
But I say in the moonlight dim and weird</br>
   A guiltless victim's pains.</br>
</br>
I bent me down to hear his sigh;</br>
   I shook with his gurgling moan,</br>
And I trembled sore when they rode away,</br>
   And left him here alone.</br>
</br>
They'd charged him with the old, old crime,</br>
   And set him fast in jail:</br>
Oh, why does the dog howl all night long,</br>
   And why does the night wind wail?</br>
</br>
He prayed his prayer and he swore his oath,</br>
   And he raised his hand to the sky;</br>
But the beat of hoofs smote on his ear,</br>
   And the steady tread drew nigh.</br>
</br>
Who is it rides by night, by night,</br>
   Over the moonlit road?</br>
And what is the spur that keeps the pace,</br>
   What is the galling goad?</br>
</br>
And now they beat at the prison door,</br>
   \"Ho, keeper, do not stay!</br>
                            We are friends of him whom you hold within,</br>
                            And we fain would take him away</br>
                            </br>
                            \"From those who ride fast on our heels</br>
                            With mind to do him wrong;</br>
                            They have no care for his innocence,</br>
                            And the rope they bear is long.\"</br>
                            </br>
                            They have fooled the jailer with lying words,</br>
                            They have fooled the man with lies;</br>
                            The bolts unbar, the locks are drawn,</br>
                            And the great door open flies.</br>
                            </br>
                            Now they have taken him from the jail,</br>
                            And hard and fast they ride,</br>
                            And the leader laughs low down in his throat,</br>
                            As they halt my trunk beside.</br>
                            </br>
                            Oh, the judge, he wore a mask of black,</br>
                            And the doctor one of white,</br>
                            And the minister, with his oldest son,</br>
                            Was curiously bedight.</br>
                            </br>
                            Oh, foolish man, why weep you now?</br>
                            'Tis but a little space,</br>
                            And the time will come when these shall dread</br>
                            The mem'ry of your face.</br>
                            </br>
                            I feel the rope against my bark,</br>
                            And the weight of him in my grain,</br>
                            I feel in the throe of his final woe</br>
                            The touch of my own last pain.</br>
                            </br>
                            And never more shall leaves come forth</br>
                            On the bough that bears the ban;</br>
                            I am burned with dread, I am dried and dead,</br>
                            From the curse of a guiltless man.</br>
                            </br>
                            And ever the judge rides by, rides by,</br>
                            And goes to hunt the deer,</br>
                            And ever another rides his soul</br>
                            In the guise of a mortal fear.</br>
                            </br>
                            And ever the man he rides me hard,</br>
                            And never a night stays he;</br>
                            For I feel his curse as a haunted bough,</br>
                            On the trunk of a haunted tree.</br>
