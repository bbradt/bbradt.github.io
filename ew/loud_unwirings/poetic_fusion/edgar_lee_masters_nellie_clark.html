                        <p ">
I was only eight years old;</br>
And before I grew up and knew what it meant</br>
I had no words for it, except</br>
That I was frightened and told my</br>
Mother; And that my Father got a pistol</br>
And would have killed Charlie, who was a big boy,</br>
Fifteen years old, except for his Mother.</br>
Nevertheless the story clung to me.</br>
But the man who married me, a widower of thirty-five,</br>
Was a newcomer and never heard it</br>
Till two years after we were married.</br>
Then he considered himself cheated,</br>
And the village agreed that I was not really a virgin.</br>
Well, he deserted me, and I died</br>
The following winter.</br>
