                        <h2>from The Bridge: Quaker Hill</h2>
                        <h3>By: HART CRANE</h3>
                        <p ">
Perspective never withers from their eyes;   </br>
They keep that docile edict of the Spring</br>
That blends March with August Antarctic skies:   </br>
These are but cows that see no other thing   </br>
Than grass and snow, and their own inner being   </br>
Through the rich halo that they do not trouble   </br>
Even to cast upon the seasons fleeting</br>
Though they should thin and die on last years stubble.</br>
</br>
And they are awkward, ponderous and uncoy . . .   </br>
While we who press the cider mill, regarding them</br>
We, who with pledges taste the bright annoy   </br>
Of friendships acid wine, retarding phlegm,</br>
Shifting reprisals (til who shall tell us when</br>
The jest is too sharp to be kindly?) boast</br>
Much of our store of faith in other men</br>
Who would, ourselves, stalk down the merriest ghost.</br>
</br>
Above them old Mizzentop, palatial white   </br>
Hostelryfloor by floor to cinquefoil dormer   </br>
Portholes the ceilings stack their stoic height.   </br>
Long tiers of windows staring out toward former   </br>
Facesloose panes crown the hill and gleam   </br>
At sunset with a silent, cobwebbed patience . . .   </br>
</br>
See them, like eyes that still uphold some dream   </br>
Through mapled vistas, cancelled reservations!</br>
</br>
High from the central cupola, they say</br>
Ones glance could cross the borders of three states;   </br>
But I have seen deaths stare in slow survey   </br>
From four horizons that no one relates . . .   </br>
Weekenders avid of their turf-won scores,</br>
Here three hours from the semaphores, the Czars</br>
Of golf, by twos and threes in plaid plusfours   </br>
Alight with sticks abristle and cigars.</br>
</br>
This was the Promised Land, and still it is</br>
To the persuasive suburban land agent</br>
In bootleg roadhouses where the gin fizz</br>
Bubbles in time to Hollywoods new love-nest pageant.   </br>
Fresh from the radio in the old Meeting House   </br>
(Now the New Avalon Hotel) volcanoes roar</br>
A welcome to highsteppers that no mouse</br>
Who saw the Friends there ever heard before.</br>
</br>
What cunning neighbors history has in fine!   </br>
The woodlouse mortgages the ancient deal   </br>
Table that Powitzky buys for only nine-   </br>
Ty-five at Adams auction,eats the seal,   </br>
The spinster polish of antiquity . . .   </br>
Who holds the lease on time and on disgrace?   </br>
What eats the pattern with ubiquity?</br>
Where are my kinsmen and the patriarch race?</br>
</br>
The resigned factions of the dead preside.   </br>
Dead rangers bled their comfort on the snow;   </br>
But I must ask slain Iroquois to guide</br>
Me farther than scalped Yankees knew to go:   </br>
Shoulder the curse of sundered parentage,   </br>
Wait for the postman driving from Birch Hill   </br>
With birthright by blackmail, the arrant page   </br>
That unfolds a new destiny to fill . . . .   </br>
</br>
So, must we from the hawks far stemming view,   </br>
Must we descend as worms eye to construe   </br>
Our love of all we touch, and take it to the Gate</br>
As humbly as a guest who knows himself too late,</br>
His news already told? Yes, while the heart is wrung,</br>
Ariseyes, take this sheaf of dust upon your tongue!</br>
In one last angelus lift throbbing throat</br>
Listen, transmuting silence with that stilly note</br>
</br>
Of pain that Emily, that Isadora knew!</br>
While high from dim elm-chancels hung with dew,</br>
That triple-noted clause of moonlight</br>
Yes, whip-poor-will, unhusks the heart of fright,</br>
Breaks us and saves, yes, breaks the heart, yet yields</br>
That patience that is armour and that shields</br>
Love from despairwhen love forsees the end</br>
Leaf after autumnal leaf</br>
                                    break off,</br>
                                                   descend</br>
                                                               descend</br>
