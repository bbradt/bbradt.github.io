<h2>The Wild Common</h2>
<h3>By: D. H. LAWRENCE</h3>
<p">
[Version 1: 1921]</br>
The quick sparks on the gorse bushes are leaping,</br>
Little jets of sunlight-texture imitating flame;</br>
Above them, exultant, the peewits are sweeping:</br>
They are lords of the desolate wastes of sadness their screamings proclaim.</br>
</br>
Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie</br>
Low-rounded on the mournful grass they have bitten down to the quick.</br>
Are they asleep?  Are they alive?  Now see, when I</br>
Move my arms the hill bursts and heaves under their spurting kick.</br>
</br>
The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the rushes</br>
Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the blossoming bushes;</br>
There the lazy streamlet pushes</br>
Its curious course mildly; here it wakes again, leaps, laughs, and gushes.</br>
</br>
Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,</br>
Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook ebbing through so slow,</br>
Naked on the steep, soft lip</br>
Of the bank I stand watching my own white shadow quivering to and fro.</br>
</br>
What if the gorse flowers shrivelled and kissing were lost?</br>
Without the pulsing waters, where were the marigolds and the songs of the brook!</br>
If my veins and my breasts with love embossed</br>
Withered, my insolent soul would be gone like flowers that the hot wind took.</br>
</br>
So my soul like a passionate woman turns,</br>
Filled with remorseful terror to the man she scorned, and her love</br>
For myself in my own eyes' laughter burns,</br>
Runs ecstatic over the pliant folds rippling down to my belly from the breast-lights above.</br>
</br>
Over my sunlit skin the warm, clinging air,</br>
Rich with the songs of seven larks singing at once, goes kissing me glad.</br>
And the soul of the wind and my blood compare</br>
Their wandering happiness, and the wind, wasted in liberty, drifts on and is sad.</br>
</br>
Oh but the water loves me and folds me,</br>
Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me as though it were living blood,</br>
Blood of a heaving woman who holds me,</br>
Owning my supple body a rare glad thing, supremely good.</br>
</br>
[Version 2: 1928]</br>
The quick sparks on the gorse-bushes are leaping</br>
Little jets of sunlight texture imitating flame;</br>
Above them, exultant, the peewits are sweeping:</br>
They have triumphed again o'er the ages, their screamings proclaim.</br>
</br>
Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie</br>
Low-rounded on the mournful turf they have bitten down to the quick.</br>
Are they asleep?  are they living?  Now see, when I</br>
Lift my arms, the hill bursts and heaves under their spurting kick!</br>
</br>
The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the rushes</br>
Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the blossoming bushes;</br>
There the lazy streamlet pushes</br>
His bent course mildly; here wakes again, leaps, laughs, and gushes</br>
</br>
Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,</br>
Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook ebbing through so slow;</br>
Naked on the steep, soft lip</br>
Of the turf I stand watching my own white shadow quivering to and fro.</br>
</br>
What if the gorse-flowers shrivelled, and I were gone?</br>
What if the waters ceased, where were the marigolds then, and the gudgeon?</br>
What is this thing that I look down upon?</br>
White on the water wimples my shadow, strains like a dog on a string, to run on.</br>
</br>
How it looks back, like a white dog to its master!</br>
I on the bank all substance, my shadow all shadow looking up to me, looking back!</br>
And the water runs, and runs faster, runs faster,</br>
And the white dog dances and quivers, I am holding his cord quite slack.</br>
</br>
But how splendid it is to be substance, here!</br>
My shadow is neither here nor there; but I, I am royally here!</br>
I am here! I am here! screams the peewit; the may-blobs burst out in a laugh as they hear!</br>
Here! flick the rabbits. Here! pants the gorse. Here! say the insects far and near.</br>
</br>
Over my skin in the sunshine, the warm, clinging air</br>
Flushed with the songs of seven larks singing at once, goes kissing me glad.</br>
You are here! You are here! We have found you! Everywhere</br>
We sought you substantial, you touchstone of caresses, you naked lad!</br>
</br>
Oh but the water loves me and folds me,</br>
Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me, murmurs: Oh marvellous stuff!</br>
No longer shadow!  and it holds me</br>
Close, and it rolls me, enfolds me, touches me, as if never it could touch me enough.</br>
</br>
Sun, but in substance, yellow water-blobs!</br>
Wings and feathers on the crying, mysterious ages, peewits wheeling!</br>
All that is right, all that is good; all that is God takes substance! a rabbit lobs</br>
In confirmation, I hear sevenfold lark-songs pealing.</br>
