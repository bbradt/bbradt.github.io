                        <h3>By: WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS</h3>
                        <p ">
The woods of Arcady are dead,</br>
And over is their antique joy;</br>
Of old the world on dreaming fed;</br>
Grey Truth is now her painted toy;</br>
Yet still she turns her restless head:</br>
But O, sick children of the world,</br>
Of all the many changing things</br>
In dreary dancing past us whirled,</br>
To the cracked tune that Chronos sings,</br>
Words alone are certain good.</br>
Where are now the warring kings,</br>
Word be-mockers?  By the Rood</br>
Where are now the warring kings?</br>
An idle word is now their glory,</br>
By the stammering schoolboy said,</br>
Reading some entangled story:</br>
The kings of the old time are dead;</br>
The wandering earth herself may be</br>
Only a sudden flaming word,</br>
In clanging space a moment heard,</br>
Troubling the endless reverie.</br>
</br>
Then nowise worship dusty deeds,</br>
Nor seek, for this is also sooth,</br>
To hunger fiercely after truth,</br>
Lest all thy toiling only breeds</br>
New dreams, new dreams; there is no truth</br>
Saving in thine own heart. Seek, then,</br>
No learning from the starry men,</br>
Who follow with the optic glass</br>
The whirling ways of stars that pass  </br>
Seek, then, for this is also sooth,</br>
No word of theirs  the cold star-bane</br>
Has cloven and rent their hearts in twain,</br>
And dead is all their human truth.</br>
Go gather by the humming sea</br>
Some twisted, echo-harbouring shell,</br>
And to its lips thy story tell,</br>
And they thy comforters will be,</br>
Rewarding in melodious guile</br>
Thy fretful words a little while,</br>
Till they shall singing fade in ruth</br>
And die a pearly brotherhood;</br>
For words alone are certain good:</br>
Sing, then, for this is also sooth.</br>
</br>
I must be gone: there is a grave</br>
Where daffodil and lily wave,</br>
And I would please the hapless faun,</br>
Buried under the sleepy ground,</br>
With mirthful songs before the dawn.</br>
His shouting days with mirth were crowned;</br>
And still I dream he treads the lawn,</br>
Walking ghostly in the dew,</br>
Pierced by my glad singing through,</br>
My songs of old earth's dreamy youth:</br>
But ah! she dreams not now; dream thou!</br>
For fair are poppies on the brow:</br>
Dream, dream, for this is also sooth.</br>
