                        <h2>Almond Blossom</h2>
                        <h3>By: D. H. LAWRENCE</h3>
                        <p ">
Even iron can put forth,</br>
Even iron.</br>
</br>
This is the iron age,</br>
But let us take heart</br>
Seeing iron break and bud,</br>
Seeing rusty iron puff with clouds of blossom.</br>
</br>
The almond-tree,</br>
December's bare iron hooks sticking out of earth.</br>
</br>
The almond-tree,</br>
That knows the deadliest poison, like a snake</br>
In supreme bitterness.</br>
</br>
Upon the iron, and upon the steel,</br>
Odd flakes as if of snow, odd bits of snow,</br>
Odd crumbs of melting snow.</br>
</br>
But you mistake, it is not from the sky;</br>
From out the iron, and from out the steel,</br>
Flying not down from heaven, but storming up,</br>
Strange storming up from the dense under-earth</br>
Along the iron, to the living steel</br>
In rose-hot tips, and flakes of rose-pale snow</br>
Setting supreme annunciation to the world.</br>
</br>
Nay, what a heart of delicate super-faith,</br>
Iron-breaking,</br>
The rusty swords of almond-trees.</br>
</br>
Trees suffer, like races, down the long ages.</br>
They wander and are exiled, they live in exile through long ages</br>
Like drawn blades never sheathed, hacked and gone black,</br>
The alien trees in alien lands: and yet</br>
The heart of blossom,</br>
The unquenchable heart of blossom!</br>
</br>
Look at the many-cicatrised frail vine, none more scarred and frail,</br>
Yet see him fling himself abroad in fresh abandon</br>
From the small wound-stump.</br>
</br>
Even the wilful, obstinate, gummy fig-tree</br>
Can be kept down, but he'll burst like a polyp into prolixity.</br>
</br>
And the almond-tree, in exile, in the iron age!</br>
</br>
This is the ancient southern earth whence the vases were baked, amphoras, craters, cantharus, oenochoe, and open-hearted cylix,</br>
Bristling now with the iron of almond-trees</br>
</br>
Iron, but unforgotten,</br>
Iron, dawn-hearted,</br>
Ever-beating dawn-heart, enveloped in iron against the exile, against the ages.</br>
</br>
See it come forth in blossom</br>
From the snow-remembering heart</br>
In long-nighted January,</br>
In the long dark nights of the evening star, and Sirius, and the Etna snow-wind through the long night.</br>
</br>
Sweating his drops of blood through the long-nighted Gethsemane</br>
Into blossom, into pride, into honey-triumph, into most exquisite splendour.</br>
Oh, give me the tree of life in blossom</br>
And the Cross sprouting its superb and fearless flowers!</br>
</br>
Something must be reassuring to the almond, in the evening star, and the snow-wind, and the long, long, nights,</br>
Some memory of far, sun-gentler lands,</br>
So that the faith in his heart smiles again</br>
And his blood ripples with that untenable delight of once-more-vindicated faith,</br>
And the Gethsemane blood at the iron pores unfolds, unfolds,</br>
Pearls itself into tenderness of bud</br>
And in a great and sacred forthcoming steps forth, steps out in one stride</br>
A naked tree of blossom, like a bridegroom bathing in dew, divested of cover,</br>
Frail-naked, utterly uncovered</br>
To the green night-baying of the dog-star, Etna's snow-edged wind</br>
And January's loud-seeming sun.</br>
</br>
Think of it, from the iron fastness</br>
Suddenly to dare to come out naked, in perfection of blossom, beyond the sword-rust.</br>
Think, to stand there in full-unfolded nudity, smiling,</br>
With all the snow-wind, and the sun-glare, and the dog-star baying epithalamion.</br>
</br>
Oh, honey-bodied beautiful one,</br>
Come forth from iron,</br>
Red your heart is.</br>
Fragile-tender, fragile-tender life-body,</br>
More fearless than iron all the time,</br>
And so much prouder, so disdainful of reluctances.</br>
</br>
In the distance like hoar-frost, like silvery ghosts communing on a green hill,</br>
Hoar-frost-like and mysterious.</br>
</br>
In the garden raying out</br>
With a body like spray, dawn-tender, and looking about</br>
With such insuperable, subtly-smiling assurance,</br>
Sword-blade-born.</br>
</br>
Unpromised,</br>
No bounds being set.</br>
Flaked out and come unpromised,</br>
The tree being life-divine,</br>
Fearing nothing, life-blissful at the core</br>
Within iron and earth.</br>
</br>
Knots of pink, fish-silvery</br>
In heaven, in blue, blue heaven,</br>
Soundless, bliss-full, wide-rayed, honey-bodied,</br>
Red at the core,</br>
Red at the core,</br>
Knotted in heaven upon the fine light.</br>
</br>
Open,</br>
Open,</br>
Five times wide open,</br>
Six times wide open,</br>
And given, and perfect;</br>
And red at the core with the last sore-heartedness,</br>
Sore-hearted-looking.</br>
