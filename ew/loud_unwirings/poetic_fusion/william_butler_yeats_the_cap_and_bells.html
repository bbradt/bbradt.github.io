                        <h2>The Cap and Bells</h2>
                        <h3>By: WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS</h3>
                        <p ">
The jester walked in the garden:</br>
The garden had fallen still;</br>
He bade his soul rise upward</br>
And stand on her window-sill.</br>
</br>
It rose in a straight blue garment,</br>
When owls began to call:</br>
It had grown wise-tongued by thinking</br>
Of a quiet and light footfall;</br>
</br>
But the young queen would not listen;</br>
She rose in her pale night-gown;</br>
She drew in the heavy casement</br>
And pushed the latches down.</br>
</br>
He bade his heart go to her,</br>
When the owls called out no more;</br>
In a red and quivering garment</br>
It sang to her through the door.</br>
</br>
It had grown sweet-tongued by dreaming</br>
Of a flutter of flower-like hair;</br>
But she took up her fan from the table</br>
And waved it off on the air.</br>
</br>
'I have cap and bells, he pondered,</br>
'I will send them to her and die;</br>
And when the morning whitened</br>
He left them where she went by.</br>
</br>
She laid them upon her bosom,</br>
Under a cloud of her hair,</br>
And her red lips sang them a love-song</br>
Till stars grew out of the air.</br>
</br>
She opened her door and her window,</br>
And the heart and the soul came through,</br>
To her right hand came the red one,</br>
To her left hand came the blue.</br>
</br>
They set up a noise like crickets,</br>
A chattering wise and sweet,</br>
And her hair was a folded flower</br>
And the quiet of love in her feet.</br>
