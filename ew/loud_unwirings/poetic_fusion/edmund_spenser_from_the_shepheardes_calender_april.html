<h2>from The Shepheardes Calender: April</h2>
<h3>By: EDMUND SPENSER</h3>
<p">
THENOT    &      HOBBINOLL</br>
Tell me good Hobbinoll, what garres thee greete?</br>
What? hath some Wolfe thy tender Lambes ytorne?</br>
Or is thy Bagpype broke, that soundes so sweete?</br>
Or art thou of thy loved lasse forlorne?</br>
</br>
Or bene thine eyes attempred to the yeare,</br>
Quenching the gasping furrowes thirst with rayne?</br>
Like April shoure, so stremes the trickling teares</br>
Adowne thy cheeke, to quenche thy thristye payne.</br>
</br>
HOBBINOLL</br>
Nor thys, nor that, so muche doeth make me mourne,</br>
But for the ladde, whome long I lovd so deare,</br>
Nowe loves a lasse, that all his love doth scorne:</br>
He plongd in payne, his tressed locks dooth teare.</br>
</br>
Shepheards delights he dooth them all forsweare,</br>
Hys pleasaunt Pipe, whych made us meriment,</br>
He wylfully hath broke, and doth forbeare</br>
His wonted songs, wherein he all outwent.</br>
</br>
THENOT</br>
What is he for a Ladde, you so lament?</br>
Ys love such pinching payne to them, that prove?</br>
And hath he skill to make so excellent,</br>
Yet hath so little skill to brydle love?</br>
</br>
HOBBINOLL</br>
Colin thou kenst, the Southerne shepheardes boye:</br>
Him Love hath wounded with a deadly darte.</br>
Whilome on him was all my care and joye,</br>
Forcing with gyfts to winne his wanton heart.</br>
</br>
But now from me hys madding mynd is starte,</br>
And woes the Widdowes daughter of the glenne:</br>
So nowe fayre Rosalind hath bredde hys smart,</br>
So now his frend is chaunged for a frenne.</br>
</br>
THENOT</br>
But if hys ditties bene so trimly dight,</br>
I pray thee Hobbinoll, recorde some one:</br>
The whiles our flockes doe graze about in sight,</br>
And we close shrowded in thys shade alone.</br>
</br>
HOBBINOLL</br>
Contented I: then will I singe his laye</br>
Of fayre Elisa, Queene of shepheardes all:</br>
Which once he made, as by a spring he laye,</br>
And tuned it unto the Waters fall.</br>
</br>
Ye dayntye Nymphs, that in this blessed Brooke</br>
         doe bathe your brest,</br>
Forsake your watry bowres, and hether looke,</br>
         at my request:</br>
And eke you Virgins, that on Parnasse dwell,</br>
Whence floweth Helicon the learned well,</br>
         Helpe me to blaze</br>
         Her worthy praise,</br>
Which in her sexe doth all excell.</br>
</br>
Of fayre Eliza be your silver song,</br>
         that blessed wight:</br>
The flowre of Virgins, may shee florish long,</br>
         In princely plight.</br>
For shee is Syrinx daughter without spotte,</br>
Which Pan the shepheards God of her begot:</br>
         So sprong her grace</br>
         Of heavenly race,</br>
No mortall blemishe may her blotte.</br>
</br>
See, where she sits upon the grassie greene,</br>
         (O seemely sight)</br>
Yclad in Scarlot like a mayden Queene,</br>
         And Ermines white.</br>
Upon her head a Cremosin coronet,</br>
With Damaske roses and Daffadillies set:</br>
         Bayleaves betweene,</br>
         And Primroses greene</br>
Embellish the sweete Violet.</br>
</br>
Tell me, have ye seene her angelick face,</br>
         Like Ph{oe}be fayre?</br>
Her heavenly haveour, her princely grace</br>
         can you well compare?</br>
The Redde rose medled with the White yfere,</br>
In either cheeke depeincten lively chere.</br>
         Her modest eye,</br>
         Her Majestie,</br>
Where have you seene the like, but there?</br>
</br>
I sawe Ph{oe}bus thrust out his golden hedde,</br>
         upon her to gaze:</br>
But when he sawe, how broade her beames did spredde,</br>
         it did him amaze.</br>
He blusht to see another Sunne belowe,</br>
Ne durst againe his fyrye face out showe:</br>
         Let him, if he dare,</br>
         His brightnesse compare</br>
With hers, to have the overthrowe.</br>
</br>
Shewe thy selfe Cynthia with thy silver rayes,</br>
         and be not abasht:</br>
When shee the beames of her beauty displayes,</br>
         O how art thou dasht?</br>
But I will not match her with Latonaes seede,</br>
Such follie great sorow to Niobe did breede.</br>
         Now she is a stone,</br>
         And makes dayly mone,</br>
Warning all other to take heede.</br>
</br>
Pan may be proud, that ever he begot</br>
         such a Bellibone,</br>
And Syrinx rejoyse, that ever was her lot</br>
         to beare such an one.</br>
Soone as my younglings cryen for the dam,</br>
To her will I offer a milkwhite Lamb:</br>
         Shee is my goddesse plaine,</br>
         And I her shepherds swayne,</br>
Albee forswonck and forswatt I am.</br>
</br>
I see Calliope speede her to the place,</br>
         where my Goddesse shines:</br>
And after her the other Muses trace,</br>
         with their Violines.</br>
Bene they not Bay braunches, which they doe beare,</br>
All for Elisa in her hand to weare?</br>
         So sweetely they play,</br>
         And sing all the way,</br>
That it a heaven is to heare.</br>
</br>
Lo how finely the graces can it foote</br>
         to the Instrument:</br>
They dauncen deffly, and singen soote,</br>
         in their meriment.</br>
Wants not a fourth grace, to make the daunce even?</br>
Let that rowme to my Lady be yeven:</br>
         She shalbe a grace,</br>
         To fyll the fourth place,</br>
And reigne with the rest in heaven.</br>
</br>
And whither rennes this bevie of Ladies bright,</br>
         raunged in a rowe?</br>
They bene all Ladyes of the lake behight,</br>
         that unto her goe.</br>
Chloris, that is the chiefest Nymph of al,</br>
Of Olive braunches beares a Coronall:</br>
         Olives bene for peace,</br>
         When wars doe surcease:</br>
Such for a Princesse bene principall.</br>
</br>
Ye shepheards daughters, that dwell on the greene,</br>
         hye you there apace:</br>
Let none come there, but that Virgins bene,</br>
         to adorne her grace.</br>
And when you come, whereas shee is in place,</br>
See, that your rudeness doe not you disgrace:</br>
         Binde your fillets faste,</br>
         And gird in your waste,</br>
For more finesse, with a tawdrie lace.</br>
</br>
Bring hether the Pincke and purple Cullambine,</br>
         With Gelliflowres:</br>
Bring Coronations, and Sops in wine,</br>
         worne of Paramoures.</br>
Strowe me the ground with Daffadowndillies,</br>
And Cowslips, and Kingcups, and loved Lillies:</br>
         The pretie Pawnce,</br>
         And the Chevisaunce,</br>
Shall match with the fayre flowre Delice.</br>
</br>
Now ryse up Elisa, decked as thou art,</br>
         in royall aray:</br>
And now ye daintie Damsells may depart</br>
         echeone her way,</br>
I feare, I have troubled your troupes to longe:</br>
Let dame Eliza thanke you for her song.</br>
         And if you come hether,</br>
         When Damsines I gether,</br>
I will part them all you among.</br>
</br>
THENOT</br>
And was thilk same song of Colins owne making?</br>
Ah foolish boy, that is with love yblent:</br>
Great pittie is, he be in such taking,</br>
For naught caren, that bene so lewdly bent.</br>
</br>
HOBBINOLL</br>
Sicker I hold him, for a greater fon,</br>
That loves the thing, he cannot purchase.</br>
But let us homeward: for night draweth on,</br>
And twincling starres the daylight hence chase.</br>
</br>
THENOTS EMBLEME</br>
O quam te memorem virgo?</br>
</br>
HOBBINOLLS EMBLEME</br>
O dea certe.</br>
