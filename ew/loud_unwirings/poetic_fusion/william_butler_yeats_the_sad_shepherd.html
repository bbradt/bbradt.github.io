                        <h2>The Sad Shepherd</h2>
                        <h3>By: WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS</h3>
                        <p ">
There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend,</br>
And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming,</br>
Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming</br>
And humming sands, where windy surges wend:</br>
And he called loudly to the stars to bend</br>
From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they</br>
Among themselves laugh on and sing alway:</br>
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend</br>
Cried out, Dim sea, hear my most piteous story!</br>
The sea swept on and cried her old cry still,</br>
Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill.</br>
He fled the persecution of her glory</br>
And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping,</br>
Cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening.</br>
But naught they heard, for they are always listening,</br>
The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping.</br>
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend</br>
Sought once again the shore, and found a shell,</br>
And thought, I will my heavy story tell</br>
Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send</br>
Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart;</br>
And my own tale again for me shall sing,</br>
And my own whispering words be comforting,</br>
And lo! my ancient burden may depart.</br>
Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim;</br>
But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone</br>
Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan</br>
Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him.</br>
