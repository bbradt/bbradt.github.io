                        <h2>Hero and Leander</h2>
                        <h3>By: CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE</h3>
                        <p ">
On Hellespont, guilty of true love's blood,</br>
In view and opposite two cities stood,</br>
Sea-borderers, disjoin'd by Neptune's might;</br>
The one Abydos, the other Sestos hight.</br>
At Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the fair,</br>
Whom young Apollo courted for her hair,</br>
And offer'd as a dower his burning throne,</br>
Where she could sit for men to gaze upon.</br>
The outside of her garments were of lawn,</br>
The lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;</br>
Her wide sleeves green, and border'd with a grove,</br>
Where Venus in her naked glory strove</br>
To please the careless and disdainful eyes</br>
Of proud Adonis, that before her lies;</br>
Her kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,</br>
Made with the blood of wretched lovers slain.</br>
Upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,</br>
From whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath;</br>
Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves,</br>
Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives;</br>
Many would praise the sweet smell as she past,</br>
When 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;</br>
And there for honey bees have sought in vain,</br>
And beat from thence, have lighted there again.</br>
About her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,</br>
Which lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone.</br>
She ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind</br>
Would burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind,</br>
Or warm or cool them, for they took delight</br>
To play upon those hands, they were so white.</br>
Buskins of shells, all silver'd, used she,</br>
And branch'd with blushing coral to the knee;</br>
Where sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and gold,</br>
Such as the world would wonder to behold:</br>
Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills,</br>
Which as she went, would chirrup through the bills.</br>
Some say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,</br>
And looking in her face, was strooken blind.</br>
But this is true; so like was one the other,</br>
As he imagin'd Hero was his mother;</br>
And oftentimes into her bosom flew,</br>
About her naked neck his bare arms threw,</br>
And laid his childish head upon her breast,</br>
And with still panting rock'd there took his rest.</br>
So lovely-fair was Hero, Venus' nun,</br>
As Nature wept, thinking she was undone,</br>
Because she took more from her than she left,</br>
And of such wondrous beauty her bereft:</br>
Therefore, in sign her treasure suffer'd wrack,</br>
Since Hero's time hath half the world been black.</br>
</br>
         Amorous Leander, beautiful and young</br>
(Whose tragedy divine Musus sung),</br>
Dwelt at Abydos; since him dwelt there none</br>
For whom succeeding times make greater moan.</br>
His dangling tresses, that were never shorn,</br>
Had they been cut, and unto Colchos borne,</br>
Would have allur'd the vent'rous youth of Greece</br>
To hazard more than for the golden fleece.</br>
Fair Cynthia wish'd his arms might be her sphere;</br>
Grief makes her pale, because she moves not there.</br>
His body was as straight as Circe's wand;</br>
Jove might have sipt out nectar from his hand.</br>
Even as delicious meat is to the taste,</br>
So was his neck in touching, and surpast</br>
The white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell ye,</br>
How smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;</br>
And whose immortal fingers did imprint</br>
That heavenly path with many a curious dint</br>
That runs along his back; but my rude pen</br>
Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men,</br>
Much less of powerful gods: let it suffice</br>
That my slack Muse sings of Leander's eyes;</br>
Those orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his</br>
That leapt into the water for a kiss</br>
Of his own shadow, and, despising many,</br>
Died ere he could enjoy the love of any.</br>
Had wild Hippolytus Leander seen,</br>
Enamour'd of his beauty had he been.</br>
His presence made the rudest peasant melt,</br>
That in the vast uplandish country dwelt;</br>
The barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought,</br>
Was mov'd with him, and for his favour sought.</br>
Some swore he was a maid in man's attire,</br>
For in his looks were all that men desire,</br>
A pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye,</br>
A brow for love to banquet royally;</br>
And such as knew he was a man, would say,</br>
\"Leander, thou art made for amorous play;</br>
                            Why art thou not in love, and lov'd of all?</br>
                            Though thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall.\"</br>
                            </br>
                            The men of wealthy Sestos every year,</br>
                            For his sake whom their goddess held so dear,</br>
                            Rose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn feast.</br>
                            Thither resorted many a wandering guest</br>
                            To meet their loves; such as had none at all</br>
                            Came lovers home from this great festival;</br>
                            For every street, like to a firmament,</br>
                            Glister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went,</br>
                            Frighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd</br>
                            Eternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd</br>
                            As if another Pha{\"e}ton had got</br>
                            The guidance of the sun's rich chariot.</br>
                            But far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd,</br>
                            And stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind;</br>
                            For like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony,</br>
                            So was her beauty to the standers-by;</br>
                            Nor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star</br>
                            (When yawning dragons draw her thirling car</br>
                            From Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky,</br>
                            Where, crown'd with blazing light and majesty,</br>
                            She proudly sits) more over-rules the flood</br>
                            Than she the hearts of those that near her stood.</br>
                            Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase,</br>
                            Wretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race,</br>
                            Incens'd with savage heat, gallop amain</br>
                            From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain,</br>
                            So ran the people forth to gaze upon her,</br>
                            And all that view'd her were enamour'd on her.</br>
                            And as in fury of a dreadful fight,</br>
                            Their fellows being slain or put to flight,</br>
                            Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken,</br>
                            So at her presence all surpris'd and tooken,</br>
                            Await the sentence of her scornful eyes;</br>
                            He whom she favours lives; the other dies.</br>
                            There might you see one sigh, another rage,</br>
                            And some, their violent passions to assuage,</br>
                            Compile sharp satires; but, alas, too late,</br>
                            For faithful love will never turn to hate.</br>
                            And many, seeing great princes were denied,</br>
                            Pin'd as they went, and thinking on her, died.</br>
                            On this feast-dayO cursed day and hour!</br>
                            Went Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower</br>
                            To Venus' temple, where unhappily,</br>
                            As after chanc'd, they did each other spy.</br>
                            So fair a church as this had Venus none:</br>
                            The walls were of discolour'd jasper-stone,</br>
                            Wherein was Proteus carved; and over-head</br>
                            A lively vine of green sea-agate spread,</br>
                            Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,</br>
                            And with the other wine from grapes out-wrung.</br>
                            Of crystal shining fair the pavement was;</br>
                            The town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass:</br>
                            There might you see the gods in sundry shapes,</br>
                            Committing heady riots, incest, rapes:</br>
                            For know, that underneath this radiant flower</br>
                            Was Danae's statue in a brazen tower,</br>
                            Jove slyly stealing from his sister's bed,</br>
                            To dally with Idalian Ganimed,</br>
                            And for his love Europa bellowing loud,</br>
                            And tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud;</br>
                            Blood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net,</br>
                            Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set;</br>
                            Love kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy,</br>
                            Sylvanus weeping for the lovely boy</br>
                            That now is turn'd into a cypress tree,</br>
                            Under whose shade the wood-gods love to be.</br>
                            And in the midst a silver altar stood:</br>
                            There Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood,</br>
                            Vail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;</br>
                            And modestly they opened as she rose.</br>
                            Thence flew Love's arrow with the golden head;</br>
                            And thus Leander was enamoured.</br>
                            Stone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed,</br>
                            Till with the fire that from his count'nance blazed</br>
                            Relenting Hero's gentle heart was strook:</br>
                            Such force and virtue hath an amorous look.</br>
                            </br>
                            It lies not in our power to love or hate,</br>
                            For will in us is over-rul'd by fate.</br>
                            When two are stript, long ere the course begin,</br>
                            We wish that one should lose, the other win;</br>
                            And one especially do we affect</br>
                            Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:</br>
                            The reason no man knows, let it suffice,</br>
                            What we behold is censur'd by our eyes.</br>
                            Where both deliberate, the love is slight:</br>
                            Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?</br>
                        </p>
