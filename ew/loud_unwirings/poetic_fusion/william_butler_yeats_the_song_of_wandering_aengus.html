                        <h2>The Song of Wandering Aengus</h2>
                        <h3>By: WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS</h3>
                        <p ">
I went out to the hazel wood,</br>
Because a fire was in my head,</br>
And cut and peeled a hazel wand,</br>
And hooked a berry to a thread;</br>
And when white moths were on the wing,</br>
And moth-like stars were flickering out,</br>
I dropped the berry in a stream</br>
And caught a little silver trout.</br>
</br>
When I had laid it on the floor</br>
I went to blow the fire a-flame,</br>
But something rustled on the floor,</br>
And someone called me by my name:</br>
It had become a glimmering girl</br>
With apple blossom in her hair</br>
Who called me by my name and ran</br>
And faded through the brightening air.</br>
</br>
Though I am old with wandering</br>
Through hollow lands and hilly lands,</br>
I will find out where she has gone,</br>
And kiss her lips and take her hands;</br>
And walk among long dappled grass,</br>
And pluck till time and times are done,</br>
The silver apples of the moon,</br>
The golden apples of the sun.</br>
