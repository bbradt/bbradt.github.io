<h2>from The Shepheardes Calender: October</h2>
<h3>By: EDMUND SPENSER</h3>
<p">
PIERCE       &         CUDDIE</br>
Cuddie, for shame hold up thy heavye head,</br>
And let us cast with what delight to chace,</br>
And weary thys long lingring Phoebus race.</br>
Whilome thou wont the shepheards laddes to leade,</br>
In rymes, in ridles, and in bydding base:</br>
Now they in thee, and thou in sleepe art dead.</br>
</br>
CUDDY</br>
Piers, I have pyped erst so long with payne,</br>
That all mine Oten reedes bene rent and wore:</br>
And my poore Muse hath spent her spared store,</br>
Yet little good hath got, and much lesse gayne,</br>
Such pleasaunce makes the Grashopper so poore,</br>
And ligge so layd, when Winter doth her straine.</br>
</br>
The dapper ditties, that I wont devise,</br>
To feede youthes fancie, and the flocking fry,</br>
Delighten much: what I the bett for thy?</br>
They han the pleasure, I a sclender prise.</br>
I beate the bush, the byrds to them doe flye:</br>
What good thereof to Cuddie can arise?</br>
</br>
PIERS</br>
Cuddie, the prayse is better, then the price,</br>
The glory eke much greater then the gayne:</br>
O what an honor is it, to restraine</br>
The lust of lawlesse youth with good advice:</br>
Or pricke them forth with pleasaunce of thy vaine,</br>
Whereto thou list their trayned willes entice.</br>
</br>
Soone as thou gynst to sette thy notes in frame,</br>
O how the rurall routes to thee doe cleave:</br>
Seemeth thou dost their soule of sence bereave,</br>
All as the shepheard, that did fetch his dame</br>
From Plutoes balefull bowre withouten leave:</br>
His musicks might the hellish hound did tame.</br>
</br>
CUDDIE</br>
So praysen babes the Peacoks spotted traine,</br>
And wondren at bright Argus blazing eye:</br>
But who rewards him ere the more for thy?</br>
Or feedes him once the fuller by a graine?</br>
Sike prayse is smoke, that sheddeth in the skye,</br>
Sike words bene wynd, and wasten soone in vayne.</br>
</br>
PIERS</br>
Abandon then the base and viler clowne,</br>
Lyft up thy selfe out of the lowly dust:</br>
And sing of bloody Mars, of wars, of giusts.</br>
Turne thee to those, that weld the awful crowne,</br>
To doubted Knights, whose woundlesse armour rusts,</br>
And helmes unbruzed wexen dayly browne.</br>
</br>
There may thy Muse display her fluttryng wing,</br>
And stretch her selfe at large from East to West:</br>
Whither thou list in fayre Elisa rest,</br>
Or if thee please in bigger notes to sing,</br>
Advaunce the worthy whome shee loveth best,</br>
That first the white beare to the stake did bring.</br>
</br>
And when the stubborne stroke of stronger stounds,</br>
Has somewhat slackt the tenor of thy string:</br>
Of love and lustihed tho mayst thou sing,</br>
And carrol lowde, and leade the Myllers rownde,</br>
All were Elisa one of thilke same ring.</br>
So mought our Cuddies name to Heaven sownde.</br>
</br>
CUDDYE</br>
Indeed the Romish Tityrus, I heare,</br>
Through his Mecoenas left his Oaten reede,</br>
Whereon he earst had taught his flocks to feede,</br>
And laboured lands to yield the timely eare,</br>
And eft did sing of warres and deadly drede,</br>
So as the Heavens did quake his verse to here.</br>
</br>
But ah Mecoenas is yclad in claye,</br>
And great Augustus long ygoe is dead:</br>
And all the worthies liggen wrapt in leade,</br>
That matter made for Poets on to play:</br>
For ever, who in derring doe were dreade,</br>
The loftie verse of hem was loved aye.</br>
</br>
But after vertue gan for age to stoupe,</br>
And mighty manhode brought a bedde of ease:</br>
The vaunting Poets found nought worth a pease,</br>
To put in preace emong the learned troupe.</br>
Tho gan the streames of flowing wittes to cease,</br>
And sonnebright honour pend in shamefull coupe.</br>
</br>
And if that any buddes of Poesie,</br>
Yet of the old stocke gan to shoote agayne:</br>
Or it mens follies mote be forst to fayne,</br>
And rolle with rest in rymes of rybaudrye:</br>
Or as it sprong, it wither must agayne:</br>
Tom Piper makes us better melodie.</br>
</br>
PIERS</br>
O pierlesse Poesye, where is then thy place?</br>
If nor in Princes pallace thou doe sitt:</br>
(And yet is Princes pallace the most fitt)</br>
Ne brest of baser birth doth thee embrace.</br>
Then make thee winges of thine aspyring wit,</br>
And, whence thou camst, flye backe to heaven apace.</br>
</br>
CUDDIE</br>
Ah Percy it is all to weake and wanne,</br>
So high to sore, and make so large a flight:</br>
Her peeced pyneons bene not so in plight,</br>
For Colin fittes such famous flight to scanne:</br>
He, were he not with love so ill bedight,</br>
Would mount as high, and sing as soote as Swanne.</br>
</br>
PIERS</br>
Ah fon, for love does teach him climbe so hie,</br>
And lyftes him up out of the loathsome myre:</br>
Such immortall mirrhor, as he doth admire,</br>
Would rayse ones mynd above the starry skie.</br>
And cause a caytive corage to aspire,</br>
For lofty love doth loath a lowly eye.</br>
</br>
CUDDIE</br>
All otherwise the state of Poet stands,</br>
For lordly love is such a Tyranne fell:</br>
That where he rules, all power he doth expell.</br>
The vaunted verse a vacant head demaundes,</br>
Ne wont with crabbed care the Muses dwell.</br>
Unwisely weaves, that takes two webbes in hand.</br>
</br>
Who ever casts to compasse weightye prise,</br>
And thinks to throwe out thondring words of threate:</br>
Let powre in lavish cups and thriftie bitts of meate,</br>
For Bacchus fruite is frend to Phoebus wise.</br>
And when with Wine the braine begins to sweate,</br>
The nombers flowe as fast as spring doth ryse.</br>
</br>
Thou kenst not Percie howe the ryme should rage.</br>
O if my temples were distaind with wine,</br>
And girt in girlonds of wild Yvie twine,</br>
How I could reare the Muse on stately stage,</br>
And teache her tread aloft in buskin fine,</br>
With queint Bellona in her equipage.</br>
</br>
But ah my corage cooles ere it be warme,</br>
For thy, content us in thys humble shade:</br>
Where no such troublous tydes han us assayde,</br>
Here we our slender pipes may safely charme.</br>
</br>
PIERS</br>
And when my Gates shall han their bellies layd:</br>
Cuddie shall have a Kidde to store his farme.</br>
