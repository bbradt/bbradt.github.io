<h2>For The Marriage of Faustus and Helen</h2>
<h3>By: HART CRANE</h3>
<p">
I</br>
</br>
The mind has shown itself at times</br>
Too much the baked and labeled dough</br>
Divided by accepted multitudes.</br>
Across the stacked partitions of the day</br>
Across the memoranda, baseball scores,</br>
The stenographic smiles and stock quotations</br>
Smutty wings flash out equivocations.</br>
</br>
The mind is brushed by sparrow wings;</br>
Numbers, rebuffed by asphalt, crowd</br>
The margins of the day, accent the curbs,</br>
Convoying divers dawns on every corner</br>
To druggist, barber and tobacconist,</br>
Until the graduate opacities of evening</br>
Take them away as suddenly to somewhere</br>
Virginal perhaps, less fragmentary, cool.</br>
</br>
         There is the world dimensional for</br>
       those untwisted by the love of things</br>
       irreconcilable ...</br>
</br>
And yet, suppose some evening I forgot</br>
The fare and transfer, yet got by that way</br>
Without recall,lost yet poised in traffic.</br>
Then I might find your eyes across an aisle,</br>
Still flickering with those prefigurations</br>
Prodigal, yet uncontested now,</br>
Half-riant before the jerky window frame.</br>
</br>
There is some way, I think, to touch</br>
Those hands of yours that count the nights</br>
Stippled with pink and green advertisements.</br>
And now, before its arteries turn dark</br>
I would have you meet this bartered blood.</br>
Imminent in his dream, none better knows</br>
The white wafer cheek of love, or offers words</br>
Lightly as moonlight on the eaves meets snow.</br>
</br>
Reflective conversion of all things</br>
At your deep blush, when ecstasies thread</br>
The limbs and belly, when rainbows spread</br>
Impinging on the throat and sides ...   </br>
Inevitable, the body of the world</br>
Weeps in inventive dust for the hiatus</br>
That winks above it, bluet in your breasts.</br>
</br>
The earth may glide diaphanous to death;</br>
But if I lift my arms it is to bend</br>
To you who turned away once, Helen, knowing</br>
The press of troubled hands, too alternate</br>
With steel and soil to hold you endlessly.</br>
I meet you, therefore, in that eventual flame</br>
You found in final chains, no captive then</br>
Beyond their million brittle, bloodshot eyes;</br>
White, through white cities passed on to assume</br>
That world which comes to each of us alone.</br>
Accept a lone eye riveted to your plane,</br>
Bent axle of devotion along companion ways</br>
That beat, continuous, to hourless days</br>
One inconspicuous, glowing orb of praise.</br>
</br>
</br>
       II</br>
</br>
Brazen hypnotics glitter here;</br>
Glee shifts from foot to foot,</br>
Magnetic to their tremulo.</br>
This crashing opera bouffe,</br>
Blest excursion! this ricochet</br>
From roof to roof</br>
Know, Olympians, we are breathless</br>
While nigger cupids scour the stars!</br>
</br>
A thousand light shrugs balance us</br>
Through snarling hails of melody.</br>
White shadows slip across the floor</br>
Splayed like cards from a loose hand;</br>
Rhythmic ellipses lead into canters</br>
Until somewhere a rooster banters.</br>
</br>
Greet naivelyyet intrepidly</br>
New soothings, new amazements</br>
That cornets introduce at every turn</br>
And you may fall downstairs with me</br>
With perfect grace and equanimity.</br>
Or, plaintively scud past shores</br>
Where, by strange harmonic laws</br>
All relatives, serene and cool,</br>
Sit rocked in patent armchairs.</br>
</br>
O,I have known metallic paradises</br>
Where cuckoos clucked to finches</br>
Above the deft catastrophes of drums.</br>
While titters hailed the groans of death</br>
Beneath gyrating awnings I have seen</br>
The incunabula of the divine grotesque.</br>
This music has a reassuring way.</br>
</br>
The siren of the springs of guilty song</br>
Let us take her on the incandescent wax</br>
Striated with nuances, nervosities</br>
That we are heir to: she is still so young,</br>
We cannot frown upon her as she smiles,</br>
Dipping here in this cultivated storm</br>
Among slim skaters of the gardened skies.</br>
</br>
</br>
       III</br>
</br>
Capped arbiter of beauty in this street</br>
That narrows darkly into motor dawn,</br>
You, here beside me, delicate ambassador</br>
Of intricate slain numbers that arise</br>
In whispers, naked of steel;</br>
                                       religious gunman!</br>
Who faithfully, yourself, will fall too soon,</br>
And in other ways than as the wind settles</br>
On the sixteen thrifty bridges of the city:</br>
Let us unbind our throats of fear and pity.</br>
</br>
                                             We even,</br>
Who drove speediest destruction</br>
In corymbulous formations of mechanics,</br>
Who hurried the hill breezes, spouting malice</br>
Plangent over meadows, and looked down</br>
On rifts of torn and empty houses</br>
Like old women with teeth unjubilant</br>
That waited faintly, briefly and in vain:</br>
</br>
We know, eternal gunman, our flesh remembers</br>
The tensile boughs, the nimble blue plateaus,</br>
The mounted, yielding cities of the air!</br>
</br>
That saddled sky that shook down vertical</br>
Repeated play of fireno hypogeum</br>
Of wave or rock was good against one hour.</br>
We did not ask for that, but have survived,</br>
And will persist to speak again before</br>
All stubble streets that have not curved</br>
To memory, or known the ominous lifted arm</br>
That lowers down the arc of Helens brow</br>
To saturate with blessing and dismay.</br>
</br>
A goose, tobacco and cologne</br>
Three winged and gold-shod prophecies of heaven,</br>
The lavish heart shall always have to leaven</br>
And spread with bells and voices, and atone</br>
The abating shadows of our conscript dust.</br>
</br>
Anchises navel, dripping of the sea,</br>
The hands Erasmus dipped in gleaming tides,</br>
Gathered the voltage of blown blood and vine;</br>
Delve upward for the new and scattered wine,</br>
O brother-thief of time, that we recall.</br>
Laugh out the meager penance of their days</br>
Who dare not share with us the breath released,</br>
The substance drilled and spent beyond repair</br>
For golden, or the shadow of gold hair.</br>
</br>
Distinctly praise the years, whose volatile</br>
Blamed bleeding hands extend and thresh the height</br>
The imagination spans beyond despair,</br>
Outpacing bargain, vocable and prayer.</br>
