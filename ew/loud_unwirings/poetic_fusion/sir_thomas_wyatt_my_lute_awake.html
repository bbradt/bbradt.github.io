<h2>My Lute Awake</h2>
<h3>By: SIR THOMAS WYATT</h3>
<p">
My lute awake! perform the last</br>
Labour that thou and I shall waste,</br>
And end that I have now begun;</br>
For when this song is sung and past,</br>
My lute be still, for I have done.</br>
</br>
As to be heard where ear is none,</br>
As lead to grave in marble stone,</br>
My song may pierce her heart as soon;</br>
Should we then sigh or sing or moan?</br>
No, no, my lute, for I have done.</br>
</br>
The rocks do not so cruelly</br>
Repulse the waves continually,</br>
As she my suit and affection;</br>
So that I am past remedy,</br>
Whereby my lute and I have done.</br>
</br>
Proud of the spoil that thou hast got</br>
Of simple hearts thorough Love's shot,</br>
By whom, unkind, thou hast them won,</br>
Think not he hath his bow forgot,</br>
Although my lute and I have done.</br>
</br>
Vengeance shall fall on thy disdain</br>
That makest but game on earnest pain.</br>
Think not alone under the sun</br>
Unquit to cause thy lovers plain,</br>
Although my lute and I have done.</br>
</br>
Perchance thee lie wethered and old</br>
The winter nights that are so cold,</br>
Plaining in vain unto the moon;</br>
Thy wishes then dare not be told;</br>
Care then who list, for I have done.</br>
</br>
And then may chance thee to repent</br>
The time that thou hast lost and spent</br>
To cause thy lovers sigh and swoon;</br>
Then shalt thou know beauty but lent,</br>
And wish and want as I have done.</br>
</br>
Now cease, my lute; this is the last</br>
Labour that thou and I shall waste,</br>
And ended is that we begun.</br>
Now is this song both sung and past:</br>
My lute be still, for I have done.</br>
