                        <p ">
I </br>
GLOOM! </br>
An October like November; </br>
August a hundred thousand hours, </br>
And all September, </br>
A hundred thousand, dragging sunlit days, </br>
And half October like a thousand years . . . </br>
And doom! </br>
That then was Antwerp. . . </br>
                              In the name of God, </br>
How could they do it? </br>
Those souls that usually dived </br>
Into the dirty caverns of mines; </br>
Who usually hived </br>
In whitened hovels; under ragged poplars; </br>
Who dragged muddy shovels, over the grassy mud, </br>
Lumbering to work over the greasy sods. . . </br>
Those men there, with the appearance of clods </br>
Were the bravest men that a usually listless priest of God </br>
Ever shrived. . . </br>
And it is not for us to make them an anthem. </br>
If we found words there would come no wind that would fan them </br>
To a tune that the trumpets might blow it, </br>
Shrill through the heaven that's ours or yet Allah's, </br>
Or the wide halls of any Valhallas. </br>
We can make no such anthem. So that all that is ours </br>
For inditing in sonnets, pantoums, elegiacs, or lays </br>
Is this: </br>
In the name of God, how could they do it? </br>
</br>
</br>
II </br>
For there is no new thing under the sun, </br>
Only this uncomely man with a smoking gun </br>
In the gloom. . . </br>
What the devil will he gain by it? </br>
Digging a hole in the mud and standing all day in the rain by it </br>
Waiting his doom; </br>
The sharp blow, the swift outpouring of the blood, </br>
Till the trench of gray mud </br>
Is turned to a brown purple drain by it. </br>
Well, there have been scars </br>
Won in many wars . . .</br>
Punic, </br>
Lacedmonian, wars of Napoleon, wars for faith, wars for honour, for love, for possession, </br>
But this Belgian man in his ugly tunic, </br>
His ugly round cap, shooting on, in a sort of obsession, </br>
Overspreading his miserable land, </br>
Standing with his wet gun in his hand . . . </br>
Doom! </br>
He finds that in a sudden scrimmage, </br>
And lies, an unsightly lump on the sodden grass . . . </br>
An image that shall take long to pass! </br>
</br>
</br>
III </br>
For the white-limbed heroes of Hellas ride by upon their horses </br>
Forever through our brains. </br>
The heroes of Cressy ride by upon their stallions; </br>
And battalions and battalions and battalions </br>
The Old Guard, the Young Guard, the men of Minden and of Waterloo, </br>
Pass, for ever staunch, </br>
Stand, for ever true; </br>
And the small man with the large paunch, </br>
And the gray coat, and the large hat, and the hands behind the back, </br>
Watches them pass </br>
In our minds for ever . . . </br>
But that clutter of sodden corses </br>
On the sodden Belgian grass </br>
That is a strange new beauty. </br>
</br>
</br>
IV </br>
With no especial legends of marchings or triumphs or duty, </br>
Assuredly that is the way of it, </br>
The way of beauty . . . </br>
And that is the highest word you can find to say of it. </br>
For you cannot praise it with words </br>
Compounded of lyres and swords, </br>
But the thought of the gloom and the rain </br>
And the ugly coated figure, standing beside a drain, </br>
Shall eat itself into your brain: </br>
And you will say of all heroes, They fought like the Belgians! </br>
And you will say: He wrought like a Belgian his fate out of gloom. </br>
And you will say: He bought like a Belgian his doom. </br>
And that shall be an honourable name; </br>
Belgian shall be an honourable word; </br>
As honourable as the fame of the sword, </br>
As honourable as the mention of the many-chorded lyre, </br>
And his old coat shall seem as beautiful as the fabrics woven in Tyre. </br>
</br>
</br>
V </br>
And what in the world did they bear it for? </br>
I don't know. </br>
And what in the world did they dare it for? </br>
Perhaps that is not for the likes of me to understand. </br>
They could very well have watched a hundred legions go </br>
Over their fields and between their cities </br>
Down into more southerly regions. </br>
They could very well have let the legions pass through their woods, </br>
And have kept their lives and their wives and their children and cattle and goods. </br>
I don't understand. </br>
Was it just love of their land? </br>
Oh, poor dears! </br>
Can any man so love his land? </br>
Give them a thousand thousand pities </br>
And rivers and rivers of tears </br>
To wash off the blood from the cities of Flanders. </br>
</br>
</br>
VI </br>
This is Charing Cross; </br>
It is midnight; </br>
There is a great crowd </br>
And no light. </br>
A great crowd, all black that hardly whispers aloud. </br>
Surely, that is a dead womana dead mother! </br>
She has a dead face; </br>
She is dressed all in black; </br>
She wanders to the bookstall and back, </br>
At the back of the crowd; </br>
And back again and again back, </br>
She sways and wanders. </br>
</br>
This is Charing Cross; </br>
It is one o'clock. </br>
There is still a great cloud, and very little light; </br>
Immense shafts of shadows over the black crowd </br>
That hardly whispers aloud. . . </br>
And now! .  . That is another dead mother, </br>
And there is another and another and another. . . </br>
And little children, all in black, </br>
All with dead faces, waiting in all the waiting-places, </br>
Wandering from the doors of the waiting-room </br>
In the dim gloom. </br>
These are the women of Flanders.</br>
They await the lost. </br>
They await the lost that shall never leave the dock; </br>
They await the lost that shall never again come by the train </br>
To the embraces of all these women with dead faces; </br>
They await the lost who lie dead in trench and barrier and foss, </br>
In the dark of the night. </br>
This is Charing Cross; it is past one of the clock; </br>
There is very little light. </br>
</br>
There is so much pain. </br>
</br>
</br>
LEnvoi </br>
And it was for this that they endured this gloom; </br>
This October like November, </br>
That August like a hundred thousand hours, </br>
And that September, </br>
A hundred thousand dragging sunlit days, </br>
And half October like a thousand years. . . </br>
Oh, poor dears!</br>
