Canto III appeared in the July, 1917 issue of Poetry. Originally part of what scholars call the \"Ur-Cantos,\ " this version of Canto III was later edited by Pound to become Canto I of his collected Cantos. The section that eventually became Canto I is highlighted in blue in the poem below.</br>
THE EDITORS</br>
</br>
</br>
III</br>
</br>
Another's a half-cracked fellowJohn Heydon,</br>
Worker of miracles, dealer in levitation,</br>
In thoughts upon pure form, in alchemy,</br>
Seer of pretty visions (\"servant of God and secretary of nature\ ");         </br>
Full of plaintive charm, like Botticelli's,</br>
With half-transparent forms, lacking the vigor of gods.</br>
Thus Heydon, in a trance, at Bulverton,</br>
Had such a sight:</br>
Decked all in green, with sleeves of yellow silk</br>
Slit to the elbow, slashed with various purples.</br>
Her eyes were green as glass, her foot was leaf-like.</br>
She was adorned with choicest emeralds,</br>
And promised him the way of holy wisdom.</br>
\"Pretty green bank,\ " began the half-lost poem.</br>
Take the old way, say I met John Heydon,         </br>
Sought out the place,</br>
Lay on the bank, was \"plunged deep in swevyn;\ "</br>
And saw the companyLayamon, Chaucer</br>
Pass each in his appropriate robes;</br>
Conversed with each, observed the varying fashion.</br>
And then comes Heydon.</br>
                                 \"I have seen John Heydon.\ "</br>
Let us hear John Heydon!</br>
                                 \"Omniformis</br>
                            Omnis intellectus est\"thus he begins, by spouting half of Psellus.</br>
                            (Then comes a note, my assiduous commentator:</br>
                            Not Psellus De Daemonibus, but Porphyry's Chances,</br>
                            In the thirteenth chapter, that \"every intellect is omni-form.\")</br>
                            Magnifico Lorenzo used the dodge,</br>
                            Says that he met Ficino</br>
                            In some Wordsworthian, false-pastoral manner,</br>
                            And that they walked along, stopped at a well-head,</br>
                            And heard deep platitudes about contentment</br>
                            From some old codger with an endless beard.</br>
                            \"A daemon is not a particular intellect,</br>
                            But is a substance differed from intellect,\"</br>
                            Breaks in Ficino,</br>
                            \"Placed in the latitude or locus of souls\"</br>
                            That's out of Proclus, take your pick of them.</br>
                            Valla, more earth and sounder rhetoric</br>
                            Prefacing praise to his Pope Nicholas:</br>
                            \"A man of parts, skilled in the subtlest sciences;</br>
                            A patron of the arts, of poetry; and of a fine discernment.\"</br>
                            Then comes a catalogue, his jewels of conversation.</br>
                            No, you've not read your Elegantiae</br>
                            A dull book?shook the church.</br>
                            The prefaces, cut clear and hard:</br>
                            \"Know then the Roman speech, a sacrament,\"</br>
                            Spread for the nations, eucharist of wisdom,</br>
                            Bread of the liberal arts.</br>
                            Ha! Sir Blancatz,</br>
                            Sordello would have your heart to give to all the princes;</br>
                            Valla, the heart of Rome,</br>
                            Sustaining speech, set out before the people.</br>
                            \"Nec bonus Christianus ac bonus</br>
                            Tullianus.\"</br>
                            Marius, Du Bellay, wept for the buildings,</br>
                            Baldassar Castiglione saw Raphael</br>
                            \"Lead back the soul into its dead, waste dwelling,\"</br>
                            Corpore laniato; and Lorenzo Valla,</br>
                            \"Broken in middle life? bent to submission?</br>
                            Took a fat living from the Papacy\"</br>
                            (That's in Villari, but Burckhardt's statement is different)</br>
                            \"More than the Roman city, the Roman speech\"</br>
                            (Holds fast its part among the ever-living).</br>
                            \"Not by the eagles only was Rome measured.\"</br>
                            \"Wherever the Roman speech was, there was Rome,\"</br>
                            Wherever the speech crept, there was mastery</br>
                            Spoke with the law's voice while your Greek, logicians...</br>
                            More Greeks than one! Doughty's \"divine Homeros\"</br>
                            Came before sophistry. Justinopolitan</br>
                            Uncatalogued Andreas Divus,</br>
                            Gave him in Latin, 1538 in my edition, the rest uncertain,</br>
                            Caught up his cadence, word and syllable:</br>
                            \"Down to the ships we went, set mast and sail,</br>
                            Black keel and beasts for bloody sacrifice,</br>
                            Weeping we went.\"</br>
                            I've strained my ear for -ensa, -ombra, and -ensa</br>
                            And cracked my wit on delicate canzoni</br>
                            Here's but rough meaning:</br>
                            </br>
                            \"And then went down to the ship, set keel to breakers,</br>
                            Forth on the godly sea;</br>
                            We set up mast and sail on the swarthy ship,</br>
                            Sheep bore we aboard her, and our bodies also</br>
                            Heavy with weeping. And winds from sternward</br>
                            Bore us out onward with bellying canvas</br>
                            Circe's this craft, the trim-coifed goddess.</br>
                            Then sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller.</br>
                            Thus with stretched sail</br>
                            We went over sea till day's end:</br>
                            Sun to his slumber, shadows o'er all the ocean.</br>
                            Came we then to the bounds of deepest water,</br>
                            To the Kimmerian lands and peopled cities</br>
                            Covered with close-webbed mist, unpierced ever</br>
                            With glitter of sun-rays,</br>
                            Nor with stars stretched, nor looking back from heaven,</br>
                            Swartest night stretched over wretched men there.</br>
                            Thither we in that ship, unladed sheep there,</br>
                            The ocean flowing backward, came we through to the place</br>
                            Aforesaid by Circe.</br>
                            Here did they rites, Perimedes and Eurylochus,</br>
                            And drawing sword from my hip</br>
                            I dug the ell-square pitkin, poured we libations unto each the dead, </br>
                            First mead and then sweet wine,</br>
                            Water mixed with white flour.</br>
                            Then prayed I many a prayer to the sickly death's-heads</br>
                            As set in Ithaca, sterile bulls of the best,</br>
                            For sacrifice, heaping the pyre with goods.</br>
                            Sheep, to Tiresias only,</br>
                            Black, and a bell sheep;</br>
                            Dark blood flowed in the fosse.</br>
                            Souls out of Erebus, cadaverous dead</br>
                            Of brides, of youths, and of many passing old,</br>
                            Virgins tender, souls stained with recent tears,</br>
                            Many men mauled with bronze lance-heads,</br>
                            Battle spoil, bearing yet dreary arms:</br>
                            These many crowded about me,</br>
                            With shouting, pallor upon me, cried to my men for more beasts;</br>
                            Slaughtered the herdssheep slain of bronze,</br>
                            Poured ointment, cried to the gods,</br>
                            To Pluto the strong, and praised Proserpine.</br>
                            Unsheathed the narrow steel,</br>
                            I sat to keep off the impetuous, impotent dead</br>
                            Till I should hear Tiresias.</br>
                            But first Elpenor came, our friend Elpenor,</br>
                            Unburied, cast on the wide earth</br>
                            Limbs that we left in the house of Circe,</br>
                            Unwept, unwrapped in sepulchre, since toils urged other,</br>
                            Pitiful spiritand I cried in hurried speech:</br>
                            'Elpenor, how art thou come to this dark coast?</br>
                            Cam'st thou afoot, outstripping seamen?' And he in heavy speech:</br>
                            'Ill fate and abundant wine! I slept in Circe's ingle,</br>
                            Going down the long ladder unguarded, I fell against the buttress,</br>
                            Shattered the nape-nerve, the soul sought Avernus.</br>
                            But thou, O King, I bid remember me, unwept, unburied!</br>
                            Heap up mine arms, be tomb by the sea-board, and inscribed,</br>
                            A man of no fortune and with a name to come;</br>
                            And set my oar up, that I swung 'mid fellows.'</br>
                            Came then another ghost, whom I beat off, Anticlea,</br>
                            And then Tiresias, Theban,</br>
                            Holding his golden wand, knew me and spoke first:</br>
                            'Man of ill hour, why come a second time,</br>
                            Leaving the sunlight, facing the sunless dead and this joyless region?</br>
                            Stand from the fosse, move back, leave me my bloody bever,</br>
                            And I will speak you true speeches.'</br>
                            \"And I stepped back,</br>
                            Sheathing the yellow sword. Dark blood he drank then</br>
                            And spoke: 'Lustrous Odysseus, shalt</br>
                            Return through spiteful Neptune, over dark seas,</br>
                            Lose all companions.' Foretold me the ways and the signs.</br>
                            Came then Anticlea, to whom I answered:</br>
                            'Fate drives me on through these deeps; I sought Tiresias.'</br>
                            I told her news of Troy, and thrice her shadow</br>
                            Faded in my embrace.</br>
                            Then had I news of many faded women</br>
                            Tyro, Alcmena, Chloris</br>
                            Heard out their tales by that dark fosse, and sailed</br>
                            By sirens and thence outward and away,</br>
                            And unto Circe buried Elpenor's corpse.\"</br>
                            </br>
                            Lie quiet, Divus.</br>
                            In Officina Wechli, Paris,</br>

                            Gives way before the florid mellow phrase.)</br>
                            Take we the Goddess, Venus:</br>

                            And air-tending hours. Mirthful, orichalci, with golden</br>
