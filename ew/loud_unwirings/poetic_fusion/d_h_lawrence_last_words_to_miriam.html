<h2>Last Words to Miriam</h2>
<h3>By: D. H. LAWRENCE</h3>
<p">
Version 1 (1921)</br>
Yours is the shame and sorrow,</br>
But the disgrace is mine;</br>
Your love was dark and thorough,</br>
Mine was the love of the sun for a flower</br>
He creates with his shine.</br>
</br>
I was diligent to explore you,</br>
Blossom you stalk by stalk,</br>
Till my fire of creation bore you</br>
Shrivelling down in the final dour</br>
Anguish  then I suffered a balk.</br>
</br>
I knew your pain, and it broke</br>
My fine, craftsman's nerve;</br>
Your body quailed at my stroke,</br>
And my courage failed to give you the last</br>
Fine torture you did deserve.</br>
</br>
You are shapely, you are adorned,</br>
But opaque and dull in the flesh,</br>
Who, had I but pierced with the thorned</br>
Fire-threshing anguish, were fused and cast</br>
In a lovely illumined mesh.</br>
</br>
Like a painted window: the best</br>
Suffering burnt through your flesh,</br>
Undrossed it and left it blest</br>
With a quivering sweet wisdom of grace: but now</br>
Who shall take you afresh?</br>
</br>
Now who will burn you free</br>
From your body's terrors and dross,</br>
Since the fire has failed in me?</br>
What man will stoop in your flesh to plough</br>
The shrieking cross?</br>
</br>
A mute, nearly beautiful thing</br>
Is your face, that fills me with shame</br>
As I see it hardening,</br>
Warping the perfect image of God,</br>
And darkening my eternal fame.</br>
</br>
Version 2 (1928)</br>
Yours is the sullen sorrow,</br>
The disgrace is also mine;</br>
Your love was intense and thorough,</br>
Mine was the love of a growing flower</br>
For the sunshine.</br>
</br>
You had the power to explore me,</br>
Blossom me stalk by stalk;</br>
You woke my spirit, you bore me</br>
To consciousness, you gave me the dour</br>
Awareness  then I suffered a balk.</br>
</br>
Body to body I could not</br>
Love you, although I would.</br>
We kissed, we kissed though we should not.</br>
You yielded, we threw the last cast,</br>
And it was no good.</br>
</br>
You only endured, and it broke</br>
My craftsman's nerve.</br>
No flesh responded to my stroke;</br>
So I failed to give you the last</br>
Fine torture you did deserve.</br>
</br>
You are shapely, you are adorned</br>
But opaque and null in the flesh;</br>
Who, had I but pierced with the thorned</br>
Full anguish, perhaps had been cast</br>
In a lovely illuinined mesh</br>
</br>
Like a painted window; the best</br>
Fire passed through your flesh,</br>
Undrossed it, and left it blest</br>
In clean new awareness. But now</br>
Who shall take you afresh?</br>
</br>
Now who will burn you free</br>
From your body's deadness and dross?</br>
Since the fire has failed in me,</br>
What man will stoop in your flesh to plough</br>
The shrieking cross?</br>
</br>
A mute, nearly beautiful thing</br>
Is your face, that fills me with shame</br>
As I see it hardening;</br>
I should have been cruel enough to bring</br>
You through the flame.</br>
