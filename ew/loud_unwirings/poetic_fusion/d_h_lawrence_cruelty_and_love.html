<h2>Cruelty and Love </h2>
<h3>By: D. H. LAWRENCE</h3>
<p">
What large, dark hands are those at the window</br>
Lifted, grasping the golden light</br>
Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves</br>
       To my heart's delight?</br>
</br>
Ah, only the leaves! But in the west,</br>
In the west I see a redness come</br>
Over the evening's burning breast </br>
        'Tis the wound of love goes home!</br>
</br>
The woodbine creeps abroad</br>
Calling low to her lover:</br>
The sun-lit flirt who all the day</br>
Has poised above her lips in play</br>
And stolen kisses, shallow and gay</br>
Of pollen, now has gone away</br>
 She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,</br>
And when above her his broad wings hover</br>
Then her bright breast she will uncover</br>
And yield her honey-drop to her lover.</br>
</br>
Into the yellow, evening glow</br>
Saunters a man from the farm below,</br>
Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed</br>
Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.</br>
The bird lies warm against the wall.</br>
She glances quick her startled eyes</br>
Towards him, then she turns away</br>
Her small head, making warm display</br>
Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway</br>
Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,</br>
Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies</br>
In one blue stoop from out the sties</br>
Into the evening's empty hall.</br>
</br>
Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes</br>
Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,</br>
Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,</br>
Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.</br>
</br>
The rabbit presses back her ears,</br>
Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes</br>
And crouches low: then with wild spring</br>
Spurts from the terror of his oncoming</br>
To be choked back, the wire ring</br>
Her frantic effort throttling:</br>
Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!</br>
</br>
Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,</br>
And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.</br>
Yet calm and kindly are his eyes</br>
And ready to open in brown surprise</br>
Should I not answer to his talk</br>
Or should he my tears surmise.</br>
</br>
I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair</br>
Watching the door open: he flashes bare</br>
His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes</br>
In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise</br>
He flings the rabbit soft on the table board</br>
And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword</br>
Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad</br>
Blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud</br>
His coming: he raises up my face to him</br>
And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim</br>
Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare!</br>
I know not what fine wire is round my throat,</br>
I only know I let him finger there</br>
My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat</br>
Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:</br>
And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down</br>
His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood</br>
Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood</br>
Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown</br>
Within him, die, and find death good.</br>
