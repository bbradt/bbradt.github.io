<h2>Love's Growth</h2>
<h3>By: JOHN DONNE</h3>
<p">
I scarce believe my love to be so pure</br>
   As I had thought it was,</br>
   Because it doth endure</br>
Vicissitude, and season, as the grass;</br>
Methinks I lied all winter, when I swore</br>
My love was infinite, if spring make it more.</br>
</br>
But if medicine, love, which cures all sorrow</br>
With more, not only be no quintessence,</br>
But mixed of all stuffs paining soul or sense,</br>
And of the sun his working vigor borrow,</br>
Loves not so pure, and abstract, as they use</br>
To say, which have no mistress but their muse,</br>
But as all else, being elemented too,</br>
Love sometimes would contemplate, sometimes do.</br>
</br>
And yet no greater, but more eminent,</br>
   Love by the spring is grown;</br>
   As, in the firmament,</br>
Stars by the sun are not enlarged, but shown,</br>
Gentle love deeds, as blossoms on a bough,</br>
From loves awakened root do bud out now.</br>
</br>
If, as water stirred more circles be</br>
Produced by one, love such additions take,</br>
Those, like so many spheres, but one heaven make,</br>
For they are all concentric unto thee;</br>
And though each spring do add to love new heat,</br>
As princes do in time of action get</br>
New taxes, and remit them not in peace,</br>
No winter shall abate the springs increase.</br>
