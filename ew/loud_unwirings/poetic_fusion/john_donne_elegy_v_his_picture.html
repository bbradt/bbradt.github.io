                        <p ">
Here take my picture; though I bid farewell</br>
Thine, in my heart, where my soul dwells, shall dwell.</br>
'Tis like me now, but I dead, 'twill be more</br>
When we are shadows both, than 'twas before.</br>
When weather-beaten I come back, my hand</br>
Perhaps with rude oars torn, or sun beams tann'd,</br>
My face and breast of haircloth, and my head</br>
With care's rash sudden storms being o'erspread,</br>
My body'a sack of bones, broken within,</br>
And powder's blue stains scatter'd on my skin;</br>
If rival fools tax thee to'have lov'd a man</br>
So foul and coarse as, oh, I may seem then,</br>
This shall say what I was, and thou shalt say,</br>
\"Do his hurts reach me? doth my worth decay?</br>
                            Or do they reach his judging mind, that he</br>
                            Should now love less, what he did love to see?</br>
                            That which in him was fair and delicate,</br>
                            Was but the milk which in love's childish state</br>
                            Did nurse it; who now is grown strong enough</br>
                            To feed on that, which to disus'd tastes seems tough.\"</br>
