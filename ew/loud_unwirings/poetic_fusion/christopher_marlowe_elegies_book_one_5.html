<h2>Elegies, Book One, 5</h2>
<h3>By: CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE</h3>
<p">
In summers heat and mid-time of the day</br>
To rest my limbs upon a bed I lay,</br>
One window shut, the other open stood,</br>
Which gave such light as twinkles in a wood,</br>
Like twilight glimpse at setting of the sun</br>
Or night being past, and yet not day begun.</br>
Such light to shamefaced maidens must be shown,</br>
Where they may sport, and seem to be unknown.</br>
Then came Corinna in a long loose gown,</br>
Her white neck hid with tresses hanging down:</br>
Resembling fair Semiramis going to bed</br>
Or Lais of a thousand wooers sped.</br>
I snatched her gown, being thin, the harm was small,</br>
Yet strived she to be covered therewithal.</br>
And striving thus as one that would be cast,</br>
Betrayed herself, and yielded at the last.</br>
Stark naked as she stood before mine eye,</br>
Not one wen in her body could I spy.</br>
</br>
What arms and shoulders did I touch and see,</br>
How apt her breasts were to be pressed by me?</br>
How smooth a belly under her waist saw I?</br>
How large a leg, and what a lusty thigh?</br>
To leave the rest, all liked me passing well,</br>
I clinged her naked body, down she fell,</br>
Judge you the rest: being tired she bad me kiss,</br>
Jove send me more such afternoons as this.</br>
