                        <p ">
As you came from the holy land</br>
of Walsinghame</br>
Met you not with my true love</br>
By the way as you came?</br>
</br>
How shall I know your true love</br>
That have met many one</br>
As I went to the holy land</br>
That have come, that have gone?</br>
</br>
She is neither white nor brown</br>
But as the heavens fair</br>
There is none hath a form so divine</br>
In the earth or the air.</br>
</br>
Such an one did I meet, good Sir,</br>
Such an Angelic face,</br>
Who like a queen, like a nymph, did appear</br>
By her gait, by her grace.</br>
</br>
She hath left me here all alone,</br>
All alone as unknown,</br>
Who sometimes did me lead with her self,</br>
And me loved as her own.</br>
</br>
Whats the cause that she leaves you alone</br>
And a new way doth take;</br>
Who loved you once as her own</br>
And her joy did you make?</br>
</br>
I have loved her all my youth,</br>
But now old, as you see,</br>
Love likes not the falling fruit</br>
From the withered tree.</br>
</br>
Know that love is a careless child</br>
And forgets promise past,</br>
He is blind, he is deaf when he list</br>
And in faith never fast.</br>
</br>
His desire is a dureless content</br>
And a trustless joy</br>
He is won with a world of despair</br>
And is lost with a toy.</br>
</br>
Of womenkind such indeed is the love</br>
Or the word Love abused</br>
Under which many childish desires</br>
And conceits are excused.</br>
</br>
But true Love is a durable fire</br>
In the mind ever burning;</br>
Never sick, never old, never dead,</br>
From itself never turning.</br>
