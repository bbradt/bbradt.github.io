<h2>When I Was Fair and Young</h2>
<h3>By: QUEEN ELIZABETH I</h3>
<p">
When I was fair and young, then favor graced me.</br>
Of many was I sought their mistress for to be.</br>
But I did scorn them all and answered them therefore:</br>
Go, go, go, seek some other where; importune me no more.</br>
</br>
How many weeping eyes I made to pine in woe,</br>
How many sighing hearts I have not skill to show,</br>
But I the prouder grew and still this spake therefore:</br>
Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.</br>
</br>
Then spake fair Venus son, that proud victorious boy,</br>
Saying: You dainty dame, for that you be so coy,</br>
I will so pluck your plumes as you shall say no more:</br>
Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.</br>
</br>
As soon as he had said, such change grew in my breast</br>
That neither night nor day I could take any rest.</br>
Wherefore I did repent that I had said before:</br>
Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.</br>
