                        <h3>By: JOHN DONNE</h3>
                        <p ">
All Kings, and all their favourites,</br>
         All glory of honours, beauties, wits,</br>
    The sun itself, which makes times, as they pass,</br>
    Is elder by a year now than it was</br>
    When thou and I first one another saw:</br>
    All other things to their destruction draw,</br>
         Only our love hath no decay;</br>
    This no tomorrow hath, nor yesterday,</br>
    Running it never runs from us away,</br>
But truly keeps his first, last, everlasting day.</br>
</br>
         Two graves must hide thine and my corse;</br>
         If one might, death were no divorce.</br>
    Alas, as well as other Princes, we</br>
    (Who Prince enough in one another be)</br>
    Must leave at last in death these eyes and ears,</br>
    Oft fed with true oaths, and with sweet salt tears;</br>
         But souls where nothing dwells but love</br>
    (All other thoughts being inmates) then shall prove</br>
    This, or a love increased there above,</br>
When bodies to their graves, souls from their graves remove.</br>
</br>
         And then we shall be throughly blessed;</br>
         But we no more than all the rest.</br>
    Here upon earth were Kings, and none but we</br>
    Can be such Kings, nor of such subjects be;</br>
    Who is so safe as we? where none can do</br>
    Treason to us, except one of us two.</br>
         True and false fears let us refrain,</br>
    Let us love nobly, and live, and add again</br>
    Years and years unto years, till we attain</br>
To write threescore: this is the second of our reign.</br>
