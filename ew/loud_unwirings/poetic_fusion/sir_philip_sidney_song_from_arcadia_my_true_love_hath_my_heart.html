<h2>Song from Arcadia: My True Love Hath My Heart</h2>
<h3>By: SIR PHILIP SIDNEY</h3>
<p">
My true-love hath my heart and I have his,</br>
By just exchange one for the other given:</br>
I hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss;</br>
There never was a bargain better driven.</br>
His heart in me keeps me and him in one;</br>
My heart in him his thoughts and senses guides:</br>
He loves my heart, for once it was his own;</br>
I cherish his because in me it bides.</br>
His heart his wound received from my sight;</br>
My heart was wounded with his wounded heart;</br>
For as from me on him his hurt did light,</br>
So still, methought, in me his hurt did smart:</br>
Both equal hurt, in this change sought our bliss,</br>
My true love hath my heart and I have his.</br>
