                        <h2>from The Rape of Lucrece</h2>
                        <h3>By: WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</h3>
                        <p ">
Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under,</br>
Cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss;</br>
Who, therefore angry, seems to part in sunder,</br>
Swelling on either side to want his bliss;</br>
Between whose hills her head entombed is;</br>
Where like a virtuous monument she lies,</br>
To be admired of lewd unhallowed eyes.</br>
</br>
Without the bed her other fair hand was,</br>
On the green coverlet, whose perfect white</br>
Showed like an April daisy on the grass,</br>
With pearly sweat resembling dew of night.</br>
Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,</br>
And canopied in darkness sweetly lay</br>
Till they might open to adorn the day.</br>
</br>
Her hair like golden threads played with her breath</br>
O modest wantons, wanton modesty!</br>
Showing lifes triumph in the map of death,</br>
And deaths dim look in lifes mortality.</br>
Each in her sleep themselves so beautify</br>
As if between them twain there were no strife,</br>
But that life lived in death, and death in life.</br>
</br>
Her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue,</br>
A pair of maiden worlds unconquered,</br>
Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew,</br>
And him by oath they truly honoured.</br>
These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred,</br>
Who like a foul usurper went about</br>
From this fair throne to heave the owner out.</br>
</br>
What could he see but mightily he noted?</br>
What did he note but strongly he desired?</br>
What he beheld, on that he firmly doted,</br>
And in his will his willful eye he tired.</br>
With more than admiration he admired</br>
Her azure veins, her alabaster skin,</br>
Her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin.</br>
</br>
As the grim lion fawneth oer his prey</br>
Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,</br>
So oer this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay,</br>
His rage of lust by gazing qualified;</br>
Slacked, not suppressed; for, standing by her side,</br>
His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,</br>
Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins.</br>
</br>
And they, like straggling slaves for pillage fighting,</br>
Obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting.</br>
In bloody death and ravishment delighting,</br>
Nor childrens tears nor mothers groans respecting,</br>
Swell in their pride, the onset still expecting.</br>
Anon his beating heart, alarum striking,</br>
Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking.</br>
</br>
His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye,</br>
His eye commends the leading to his hand;</br>
His hand, as proud of such a dignity,</br>
Smoking with pride, marched on to make his stand</br>
On her bare breast, the heart of all her land,</br>
Whose ranks of blue veins, as his hand did scale,</br>
Left their round turrets destitute and pale.</br>
</br>
They, mustering to the quiet cabinet</br>
Where their dear governess and lady lies,</br>
Do tell her she is dreadfully beset</br>
And fright her with confusion of their cries.</br>
She, much amazed, breaks ope her locked-up eyes,</br>
Who, peeping forth this tumult to behold,</br>
Are by his flaming torch dimmed and controlled.</br>
</br>
Imagine her as one in dead of night</br>
From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking,</br>
That thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite,</br>
Whose grim aspect sets every joint a-shaking.</br>
What terror tis! but she, in worser taking,</br>
From sleep disturbed, heedfully doth view</br>
The sight which makes supposed terror true.</br>
</br>
Wrapped and confounded in a thousand fears,</br>
Like to a new-killed bird she trembling lies.</br>
She dares not look; yet, winking, there appears</br>
Quick-shifting antics ugly in her eyes.</br>
Such shadows are the weak brains forgeries,</br>
Who, angry that the eyes fly from their lights,</br>
In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights.</br>
</br>
His hand, that yet remains upon her breast</br>
(Rude ram, to batter such an ivory wall!)</br>
May feel her heart (poor citizen) distressed,</br>
Wounding itself to death, rise up and fall,</br>
Beating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal.</br>
This moves in him more rage and lesser pity,</br>
To make the breach and enter this sweet city.</br>
