                        <h2>Love's Deity</h2>
                        <h3>By: JOHN DONNE</h3>
                        <p ">
I long to talk with some old lover's ghost,</br>
      Who died before the god of love was born.</br>
I cannot think that he, who then lov'd most,</br>
      Sunk so low as to love one which did scorn.</br>
But since this god produc'd a destiny,</br>
And that vice-nature, custom, lets it be,</br>
      I must love her, that loves not me.</br>
</br>
   Sure, they which made him god, meant not so much,</br>
      Nor he in his young godhead practis'd it.</br>
But when an even flame two hearts did touch,</br>
      His office was indulgently to fit</br>
Actives to passives. Correspondency</br>
Only his subject was; it cannot be</br>
      Love, till I love her, that loves me.</br>
</br>
   But every modern god will now extend</br>
      His vast prerogative as far as Jove.</br>
To rage, to lust, to write to, to commend,</br>
      All is the purlieu of the god of love.</br>
O! were we waken'd by this tyranny</br>
To ungod this child again, it could not be</br>
      I should love her, who loves not me.</br>
</br>
   Rebel and atheist too, why murmur I,</br>
      As though I felt the worst that love could do?</br>
Love might make me leave loving, or might try</br>
      A deeper plague, to make her love me too;</br>
Which, since she loves before, I'am loth to see.</br>
Falsehood is worse than hate; and that must be,</br>
      If she whom I love, should love me.</br>
