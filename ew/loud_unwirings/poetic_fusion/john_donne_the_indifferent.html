<h2>The Indifferent</h2>
<h3>By: JOHN DONNE</h3>
<p">
I can love both fair and brown,</br>
Her whom abundance melts, and her whom want betrays,</br>
Her who loves loneness best, and her who masks and plays,</br>
Her whom the country formed, and whom the town,</br>
Her who believes, and her who tries,</br>
Her who still weeps with spongy eyes,</br>
And her who is dry cork, and never cries;</br>
I can love her, and her, and you, and you,</br>
I can love any, so she be not true.</br>
</br>
Will no other vice content you?</br>
Will it not serve your turn to do as did your mothers?</br>
Or have you all old vices spent, and now would find out others?</br>
Or doth a fear that men are true torment you?</br>
O we are not, be not you so;</br>
Let me, and do you, twenty know.</br>
Rob me, but bind me not, and let me go.</br>
Must I, who came to travail thorough you,</br>
Grow your fixed subject, because you are true?</br>
</br>
Venus heard me sigh this song,</br>
And by love's sweetest part, variety, she swore,</br>
She heard not this till now; and that it should be so no more.</br>
She went, examined, and returned ere long,</br>
And said, Alas! some two or three</br>
Poor heretics in love there be,</br>
Which think to stablish dangerous constancy.</br>
But I have told them, Since you will be true,</br>
You shall be true to them who are false to you.</br>
