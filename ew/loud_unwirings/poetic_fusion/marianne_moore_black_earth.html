                        <h3>By: MARIANNE MOORE</h3>
                        <p ">
Openly, yes,</br>
         With the naturalness</br>
         Of the hippopotamus or the alligator</br>
When it climbs out on the bank to experience the</br>
</br>
Sun, I do these</br>
Things which I do, which please</br>
         No one but myself.  Now I breathe and now I am sub-</br>
         Merged; the blemishes stand up and shout when the object</br>
</br>
In view was a</br>
Renaissance; shall I say</br>
         The contrary?  The sediment of the river which</br>
         Encrusts my joints, makes me very gray but I am used</br>
</br>
To it, it may</br>
Remain there; do away</br>
         With it and I am myself done away with, for the</br>
         Patina of circumstance can but enrich what was</br>
</br>
There to begin</br>
With.  This elephant skin</br>
         Which I inhabit, fibered over like the shell of</br>
         The coco-nut, this piece of black glass through which no light</br>
</br>
Can filtercut</br>
Into checkers by rut</br>
         Upon rut of unpreventable experience</br>
         It is a manual for the peanut-tongued and the</br>
</br>
Hairy toed.  Black</br>
But beautiful, my back</br>
         Is full of the history of power.  Of power?  What</br>
         Is powerful and what is not?  My soul shall never</br>
</br>
Be cut into</br>
By a wooden spear; through-</br>
         Out childhood to the present time, the unity of</br>
         Life and death has been expressed by the circumference</br>
</br>
Described by my</br>
Trunk; nevertheless, I</br>
         Perceive feats of strength to be inexplicable after</br>
         All; and I am on my guard; external poise, it</br>
</br>
Has its centre</br>
Well nurturedwe know</br>
         Wherein pride, but spiritual poise, it has its centre where ?</br>
         My ears are sensitized to more than the sound of</br>
</br>
The wind.  I see</br>
And I hear, unlike the</br>
         Wandlike body of which one hears so much, which was made</br>
         To see and not to see; to hear and not to hear,</br>
</br>
That tree trunk without   </br>
Roots, accustomed to shout</br>
         Its own thoughts to itself like a shell, maintained intact   </br>
         By who knows what strange pressure of the  atmosphere; that   </br>
</br>
Spiritual   </br>
Brother to the coral</br>
         Plant, absorbed into which, the equable sapphire light</br>
         Becomes a nebulous green.  The I of each is to</br>
</br>
The I of each,</br>
A kind of fretful speech</br>
         Which sets a limit on itself; the elephant is?</br>
         Black earth preceded by a tendril?  It is to that</br>
</br>
Phenomenon</br>
The above formation,   </br>
         Translucent like the atmospherea cortex merely</br>
         That on which darts cannot strike decisively the first</br>
</br>
Time, a substance</br>
Needful as an instance</br>
         Of the indestructibility of matter; it   </br>
         Has looked at the electricity and at the earth-</br>
</br>
Quake and is still</br>
Here; the name means thick.  Will</br>
         Depth be depth, thick skin be thick, to one who can see no</br>
         Beautiful element of unreason under it?</br>
