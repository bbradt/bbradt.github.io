                        <p ">
Fie pleasure, fie! thou cloyest me with delight,</br>
Thou fillst my mouth with sweetmeats overmuch;</br>
I wallow still in joy both day and night:</br>
I deem, I dream, I do, I taste, I touch,</br>
No thing but all that smells of perfect bliss;</br>
Fie pleasure, fie! I cannot like of this.</br>
</br>
   To taste (sometimes) a bait of bitter gall,</br>
To drink a draught of sour ale (some season)</br>
To eat brown bread with homely hands in hall,</br>
Doth much increase mens appetites, by reason,</br>
And makes the sweet more sugard that ensues,</br>
Since minds of men do still seek after news.</br>
</br>
   The pamperd horse is seldom seen in breath,</br>
Whose manger makes his grace (oftimes) to melt;</br>
The crammed fowl comes quickly to his death;</br>
Such colds they catch in hottest haps that swelt;</br>
And I (much like) in pleasure scawled still,</br>
Do fear to starve although I feed my fill.</br>
</br>
   It might suffice that Love hath built his bower</br>
Between my ladys lively shining eyes;</br>
It were enough that beautys fading flower</br>
Grows ever fresh with her in heavenly wise;</br>
It had been well that she were fair of face,</br>
And yet not rob all other dames of grace.</br>
</br>
   To muse in mind, how wise, how fair, how good,</br>
How brave, how frank, how courteous, and how true</br>
My lady is, doth but inflame my blood</br>
With humours such as bid my health adieu;</br>
Since hap always when it is clomb on high,</br>
Doth fall full low, though erst it reachd the sky.</br>
</br>
   Lo, pleasure, lo! lo thus I lead a life</br>
That laughs for joy, and trembleth oft for dread;</br>
Thy pangs are such as call for changes knife</br>
To cut the twist, or else to stretch the thread,</br>
Which holds yfeer the bundle of my bliss:</br>
Fie, pleasure, fie! I dare not trust to this.</br>
