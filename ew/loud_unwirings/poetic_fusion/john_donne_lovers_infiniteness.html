                        <p ">
If yet I have not all thy love,</br>
Dear, I shall never have it all;</br>
I cannot breathe one other sigh, to move,</br>
Nor can intreat one other tear to fall;</br>
And all my treasure, which should purchase thee</br>
Sighs, tears, and oaths, and lettersI have spent.</br>
Yet no more can be due to me,</br>
Than at the bargain made was meant;</br>
If then thy gift of love were partial,</br>
That some to me, some should to others fall,</br>
         Dear, I shall never have thee all.</br>
</br>
Or if then thou gavest me all,</br>
All was but all, which thou hadst then;</br>
But if in thy heart, since, there be or shall</br>
New love created be, by other men,</br>
Which have their stocks entire, and can in tears,</br>
In sighs, in oaths, and letters, outbid me,</br>
This new love may beget new fears,</br>
For this love was not vow'd by thee.</br>
And yet it was, thy gift being general;</br>
The ground, thy heart, is mine; whatever shall</br>
         Grow there, dear, I should have it all.</br>
</br>
Yet I would not have all yet,</br>
He that hath all can have no more;</br>
And since my love doth every day admit</br>
New growth, thou shouldst have new rewards in store;</br>
Thou canst not every day give me thy heart,</br>
If thou canst give it, then thou never gavest it;</br>
Love's riddles are, that though thy heart depart,</br>
It stays at home, and thou with losing savest it;</br>
But we will have a way more liberal,</br>
Than changing hearts, to join them; so we shall</br>
         Be one, and one another's all.</br>
