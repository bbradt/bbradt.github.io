                        <h3>By: HENRY HOWARD, EARL OF SURREY</h3>
                        <p ">
O happy dames, that may embrace</br>
The fruit of your delight,</br>
Help to bewail the woeful case</br>
And eke the heavy plight</br>
Of me, that wonted to rejoice</br>
The fortune of my pleasant choice;</br>
Good ladies, help to fill my mourning voice.</br>
</br>
In ship, freight with remembrance</br>
Of thoughts and pleasures past,</br>
He sails that hath in governance</br>
My life while it will last;</br>
With scalding sighs, for lack of gale,</br>
Furthering his hope, that is his sail,</br>
Toward me, the sweet port of his avail.</br>
</br>
Alas! how oft in dreams I see</br>
Those eyes that were my food;</br>
Which sometime so delighted me,</br>
That yet they do me good;</br>
Wherewith I wake with his return,</br>
Whose absent flame did make me burn:</br>
But when I find the lack, Lord, how I mourn!</br>
</br>
When other lovers in arms across</br>
Rejoice their chief delight.</br>
Drowned in tears, to mourn my loss</br>
I stand the bitter night</br>
In my window, where I may see</br>
Before the winds how the clouds flee.</br>
Lo! what a mariner love hath made of me!</br>
</br>
And in green waves when the salt flood</br>
Doth rise by rage of wind,</br>
A thousand fancies in that mood</br>
Assail my restless mind.</br>
Alas! now drencheth my sweet foe,</br>
That with the spoil of my heart did go,</br>
And left me; but, alas! why did he so?</br>
</br>
And when the seas wax calm again</br>
To chase fro me annoy,</br>
My doubtful hope doth cause me pain;</br>
So dread cuts off my joy.</br>
Thus is my wealth mingled with woe,</br>
And of each thought a doubt doth grow;</br>
Now he comes! Will he come? Alas, no, no!</br>
